    Once READY, and unless ``wait_for_trained=False``, this also waits for
    every trainer to report its containers compiled before returning. The
    wait is skipped when no loaded skill registered an intent
    (``register_intent`` / ``padatious:register_intent``), because nothing
    can be outstanding, and when nothing on the bus trains one: no loaded
    pipeline plugin owns training state and no subscriber answers
    "mycroft.skills.train".

    The wait reads the trainer's own state rather than the bus. A plugin
    offering ``wait_until_trained`` is asked directly, and
    ``container.needs_compile`` decides whether work is outstanding.
    "mycroft.skills.trained" is not a spec topic; it is a private readiness
    signal emitted by the padatious/padacioso/nebulento family, and it is
    set before the container finishes compiling, which is the window this
    replaces rather than trusts. The
    m2v and adapt pipelines register intents synchronously and never
    subscribe to "mycroft.skills.train", so they never emit the reply — a
    boot using only those engines is fully loaded at READY and returns
    immediately, with no wait.

    Timeout behavior: ``OVOSCOPE_TRAINED_TIMEOUT`` bounds silence from an
    idle trainer, not the length of a training pass. While a pipeline plugin
    reports a pass in flight (its ``finished_training_event`` is clear, as
    ``ovos_padatious.opm`` does for the whole pass) the bound is pushed
    forward, so a skill with many locales on a loaded host is waited for
    instead of being declared stuck. ``OVOSCOPE_TRAINED_MAX`` caps the whole
    wait. A trainer that is busy is waited for even when no registration was
    observed on the bus, so a suite never runs against a container that is
    still compiling. On a raise, get_minicroft stops the MiniCroft, which
    kills the background trainer. Callers' pytest-timeout must exceed this
    wait's ceiling with margin; see "pytest-timeout Convention" in
    docs/minicroft.md.

        max_wait: Maximum seconds to wait for READY before raising TimeoutError.
        wait_for_trained: Wait for the trained-quiet-window after READY.

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If MiniCroft does not reach READY within ``max_wait`` seconds.
        RuntimeError: If a loaded skill registered intents, a pipeline

    With ``prototype=True`` (the default) this boots BOTH model2vec modes
    side by side, via ``M2V_DUAL_PIPELINE``: the classifier for the labels
    the checkpoint was trained on, and prototype mode — built at boot time
    from whatever skills load, straight from their shipped ``.intent`` files
    — for every other label. The prototype stage deny-lists the classifier's
    label set (read from the model's own ``config.json`` via
    ``m2v_model_labels``, never hard-coded) so each label is served by
    exactly one engine, and prototype runs ahead of the classifier at every
    tier: the classifier is confidently wrong on a label it never saw, while
    prototype mode cannot fire on a label denied to it, so ordering
    prototype first costs nothing on the labels the classifier owns and wins
    the only real overlap case. ``assert_m2v_label_split`` verifies this
    split holds before returning, and raises loudly if a label ends up
    served by both engines or by neither.

    With ``prototype=False`` this boots the classifier alone via
    ``M2V_PIPELINE``, exactly as it did before dual-mode existed — for
    callers who want only the trained checkpoint and no per-boot prototype
    build.

    With ``classifier=False`` this boots prototype mode alone via
    ``M2V_PROTOTYPE_PIPELINE``: the checkpoint supplies the embedding model
    and nothing else, the deny-list holds only ``ignore_intents``, and no
    label split is asserted because there is nothing to split. This is the
    boot behind the ``m2v-prototype`` preset of ``ovoscope golden``. Both
    flags ``False`` is a boot with no m2v stage at all and raises
    ``ValueError``.

    This is the reusable entry point for routing a skill's golden/e2e
    utterances through the candidate default engine. The classifier syncs the
    loaded skills' registered `<skill_id>:<intent_name>` labels at runtime and
    only matches labels that are both in the trained model and currently
    loaded, so a single boot exercises real localized routing for any skill.

    The model downloads to the shared HuggingFace cache on first use (~512MB
    for the multilingual checkpoint), so the default ``max_wait`` is generous.

    Args:
        skill_ids: One or more skill plugin IDs to load.
        model: HuggingFace repo id or local path of the model2vec classifier
            pipeline. Defaults to the multilingual candidate default engine.
        conf_high/conf_medium/conf_low: Confidence thresholds for the
            classifier's high/medium/low pipeline tiers (0.7/0.5/0.15 are

        prototype_conf_high/prototype_conf_medium/prototype_conf_low:
            Confidence thresholds for the prototype stage's tiers. Prototype
            mode scores raw cosine similarity, not a softmax probability, so
            the classifier's 0.7/0.5/0.15 defaults do not carry over; left
            unset (the default), the prototype plugin's own defaults apply.
        lang: Primary language tag (e.g. "en-US"). A multilingual model routes
            other languages regardless; set this to the utterance's language
            for correct dialog rendering.
        secondary_langs: Extra languages to load skill resources for.
        extra_pipeline_config: Merged into the ovos_m2v_pipeline (classifier)
            config section (e.g. {"renormalize": False}).
        max_wait: Seconds to wait for READY (covers first-run model download).
        wait_for_trained: Defaults False — neither m2v mode emits
            "mycroft.skills.trained"; prototype registration happens
            synchronously at READY, so there is nothing to wait for. The
            explicit default is kept for older harness versions.
        prototype: Boot both m2v modes side by side (default). ``False``
            boots the classifier alone.
        classifier: ``False`` boots prototype mode alone, with no
            classifier stage and no deny-list beyond ``ignore_intents``.
        prototype_ignore_intents: Override the prototype stage's computed
            deny-list (normally the model's own label list plus
            ``ignore_intents``) with exactly this list instead. For tests
            that need to force a label-split violation; leave unset in
            normal use.
