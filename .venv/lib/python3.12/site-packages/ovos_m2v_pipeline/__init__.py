class Model2VecIntentPipeline(ConfidenceMatcherPipeline):
    """A pipeline that integrates Model2Vec with OVOS for intent matching.

    Two operating modes are supported via ``config["mode"]``:

    ``"classifier"`` (default)
        Loads a ``StaticModelPipeline`` (embedding model + trained linear
        classifier head).  Scores are softmax probabilities.

    ``"prototype"``
        Loads a bare ``StaticModel`` (embeddings only, **no training step**).
        At runtime, builds a ``PrototypeIntentStore`` from the example
        utterances supplied by Padatious intent registrations.  Scores are
        cosine similarities.

        Padatious ``.intent`` files are read directly when
        ``padatious:register_intent`` fires; the file path is taken from
        ``message.data["file_name"]``.  Adapt intents are tracked by label
        name only and are not matched in prototype mode.

    The two score scales are not comparable, so the confidence tiers default
    differently per mode (``DEFAULT_CONF``): 0.7 / 0.5 / 0.15 for a softmax
    probability, 0.85 / 0.7 / 0.65 for a cosine. A configured ``conf_high``,
    ``conf_medium`` or ``conf_low`` overrides the default in either mode.

    ``revision`` : str, optional (default: ``None``)
        Git revision (commit SHA, branch, or tag) to pin the Hugging Face
        Hub model to, passed through to ``from_pretrained``. Unset loads
        whatever revision the Hub currently resolves as latest.

    ``low_tier`` : str, default ``"prototype"`` (classifier mode only)
        Which engine answers ``ovos-m2v-pipeline-low``. ``"prototype"``:
        the ``-high`` and ``-medium`` tiers run the trained classifier and
        the ``-low`` tier runs prototype mode, built at boot from the
        loaded skills' own templates, on the same embedding model. This
        is the default-pipeline layout: a skill the model was trained on
        is answered by the head, any other skill by its templates, one
        model in memory. ``"classifier"``: the ``-low`` tier runs the head
        at ``conf_low``, as before. The prototype stage reads
        ``low_prototype`` (a dict of prototype-mode keys, ``ignore_intents``
        included; the classifier's ``ignore_intents`` are always denied).

    The embedding model is loaded once per process and per resolved model
    path (``load_shared_model``): every instance that names the same model,
    in either mode, holds the one ``StaticModel`` object.

    Configuration keys (prototype mode)
    ------------------------------------
    ``prototype_k`` : int, optional (default: unlimited)
        Maximum number of prototype embeddings kept per label (used by the
        strategies that subsample / cluster — see ``prototype_strategy``).
        Unset (the default) keeps every registered sample as an anchor so
        that an exact training sample always scores a perfect match;
        set an integer to cap memory at the cost of recall.
    ``prototype_strategy`` : str, default ``"max_over_all"``
        One of the ``PrototypeStrategy`` values
        (``mean_centroid`` / ``medoid`` / ``max_over_all`` / ``top_k_mean`` /
        ``farthest_point`` / ``kmeans_centers`` / ``softmax_weighted``).
    ``prototype_top_k`` : int, default 3
        K for ``top_k_mean``.
    ``prototype_tau`` : float, default 0.1
        Softmax temperature for ``softmax_weighted``.

    ``intents.ovos_m2v_prototype_pipeline`` so it can coexist with the
    classifier plugin in the same OVOS instance.

    only the labels registered at runtime; for an utterance whose label the
    classifier was trained on, the nearest prototype is always some other
    label, and a prototype stage placed first claims it before the
    classifier can answer (T-1621: 7 of 117 alerts handler tests and 6 of
    53 volume golden rows lost with the prototype tiers first). Deny-list
    the classifier's trained labels in this plugin's ``ignore_intents`` so
    each label is served by one engine.
