"""On-disk cache for prototype embeddings.

Encoding every registered skill's example utterances on every boot is the
whole cost this module exists to avoid: for inputs that have not changed
since the last run (same model, same templates, same entity values), the
embeddings are read back from a small ``.npz`` file instead of being
recomputed by ``model.encode()``.

The cache is keyed on the *inputs* to a registration (model id, model2vec
version, the installed ovos-spec-tools version, the strategy/anchor-selection
parameters, and the raw pre-expansion sample lines), never on the resulting
embeddings themselves, so a changed template, a bumped model, an upgraded
spec-tools (which governs template expansion), or a different
anchor-selection setting is a plain cache miss that falls through to normal
ingest -- no separate invalidation logic is needed for the common case of
"something about this registration changed". A cached entry whose embedding dimension disagrees with the
currently-loaded model (e.g. the artifact behind an unchanged model id was
retrained in place) is likewise treated as a miss: loading it in regardless
would poison the live store with vectors of the wrong shape.

Removal (``remove()`` / ``remove_skill()``) is the one case that needs an
explicit delete: nothing about the registration inputs changes when a skill
unloads, so a stale on-disk entry would otherwise resurrect a removed
skill's intents on the next boot.

All reads/writes are local disk only; this module never touches the network.

    Layout is one subdirectory per (sanitized) skill id, with one ``.npz``
    file per intent name inside it: ``<cache_dir>/<skill>/<intent>.npz``.
    Labels are always ``<skill_id>:<intent_name>`` (the plugin's own
    namespace, including the special ``ocp:play``-style labels), so the
    split on the first ``:`` is unambiguous. This layout -- rather than a
    flat directory globbed by a sanitized ``<skill_id>:`` prefix -- exists
    because folding ``:`` to ``_`` for a flat filename is not injective:
    ``_`` is itself legal in a skill id, so a flat prefix glob for skill
    ``"skill"`` also matches files that actually belong to an unrelated
    skill ``"skill_extra"``. A subdirectory per skill has no such collision,
    and skill removal becomes a single directory delete rather than a glob.
