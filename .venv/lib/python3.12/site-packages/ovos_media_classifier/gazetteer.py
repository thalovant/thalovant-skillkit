"""Layer A — **offline popularity gazetteer** of real media titles.

The keyword (``.voc``) backend abstains on a *bare real title* it has no cue for
("attack on titan", "play interstellar", "stream the lakers game") — the
open-vocab gap.  The embedding router can route such a title **once a matching
entity slot fires**, but the router's entity stream starts EMPTY: it only fires
slots for titles the *user* injected (their personal library).  A user who never
saved "Attack on Titan" therefore gets no offline route for it.

This module closes that gap with a **default offline library**: a
popularity-ranked gazetteer of the most common real titles per media type,
derived from the metadatarr-sourced entity pools (``data/entities/*``).  It is
injected into the router's entity matcher *in addition to* the user's personal
library, so the hybrid recognises common real titles offline — no network call,
no user setup.

Why a ranked, capped head — not the whole catalogue
---------------------------------------------------
The metadatarr catalogues hold millions of rows.  Feeding all of them would
(a) over-match arbitrary words at inference (every common word is *some* obscure
title) and (b) blow up live latency — the matcher is O(titles) per query.  So we
keep only the **head of the popularity distribution**, capped top-N per type.

Two builders produce the JSON (build-time only, never shipped):

* ``data/build_gazetteer_hf.py`` (authoritative) — the **TigreGotico HF metadata
  collections**: per-source, type-correct datasets with real popularity signals
  and built-in adult flags (imdb num_votes + is_adult, anilist popularity +
  is_adult, tvmaze rating, steam reviews, podcastindex explicit, …).  No
  cross-contamination, adult excluded at source.
* ``data/build_gazetteer.py`` (fallback) — the local ``data/entities/*.csv``
  pools, ranked by ``_imdb_votes.csv`` with movie-contamination subtraction.

LIVE size MUST stay bounded: see :data:`DEFAULT_TOP_N` and the latency sweep in
``benchmarks/routing_eval.py``.  The long tail is the ONLINE metadatarr layer's
job, not a giant local set.

Safety
------
* **No adult labels.**  ``adult_title`` / ``pornstar`` / ``hentai_title`` are
  NEVER added to the offline gazetteer — an offline adult title would route into
  MOVIE / EPISODIC_SERIES and bypass the keyword adult gate.  Adult routing
  stays exclusively on the keyword content-policy axis (0.0 leak floor).
* **Minimum length.**  Single short common-word titles ("it", "up", "her") are
  dropped (``MIN_TITLE_LEN``) so the gazetteer never hijacks ordinary speech
  that merely contains a common word.  The hybrid's gate stays on keyword
  regardless, but this keeps the *leaf* honest too.

Format & persistence
--------------------
A gazetteer is a plain ``{ner_label: [title, ...]}`` dict (the same shape
:meth:`EmbeddingMediaClassifier.register_user_library` consumes).  Two sources:

* **bundled default** — :data:`BUNDLED_GAZETTEER_PATH`
  (``ovos_media_classifier/data/gazetteer.json``), a small top-N-per-type file
  shipped in the wheel so the offline route works out of the box.
* **generated full** — ``data/gazetteer.json`` (gitignored), the larger pool the
  build script writes from the local ``data/entities/*`` catalogues.

:func:`load_default_gazetteer` prefers the generated file when present, else the
bundled one, and applies the per-type size cap from config.
