"""Keyword feature slots — the contextual-classification contract.

A **keyword feature slot** is a named entity category (``artist_name``,
``movie_title``, ``tv_show_title``, …) that maps to a point on the
[taxonomy](../docs/classification-model.md): a ``mediavocab.MediaType`` (+ its
playback type and any genre tags). A slot is a *definition*; it carries no
entities of its own. Entities are filled in at **runtime** from whatever media
is actually available — a Jellyfin library, the *arr stack (Radarr/Sonarr/
Lidarr), Music Assistant, a CSV/HF export (see
[entity lists](../docs/entity-lists.md) and ``entities.EntitiesContainer``).

The same slots drive **two** classifier mechanisms from one contract:

* **NER (exact match)** — a query containing a slot's entity yields that slot's
  ``media_type`` directly. Because the slot is filled with *your* media, the
  signal is grounded and high-confidence: "play Inception" resolves to ``MOVIE``
  *because Inception is in your Radarr*, not because of a guessed cue.
* **Guided embeddings (learned features)** — each slot is a categorical feature
  ("does the query contain a known ``artist_name``?"). A model learns weights
  over the slots; at runtime the slots are filled with the available entities,
  so the features — and therefore the prediction — are **biased toward the media
  you actually own**. Defining the labels statically and filling them at runtime
  is the same pattern as the ``guided-categorical-embeddings`` library.

This is what makes classification **contextual**: available media *influences*
the prediction. Ambiguous requests lean toward what is present; a slot with no
entities contributes nothing. It is the principled form of "constrain the leaf"
— grounded in real inventory rather than a noisy modality guess.

``KEYWORD_FEATURE_SLOTS`` is derived from the canonical
``NER_LABEL_TO_MEDIA_TYPE`` + ``NER_LABEL_TO_GENRES`` maps, so it is a
formalized *view* of the existing taxonomy with no second source of truth to
drift.
