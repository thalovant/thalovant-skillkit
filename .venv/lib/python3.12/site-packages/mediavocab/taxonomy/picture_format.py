"""PictureFormat — the presentation/picture-attribute axis. Spec §3.11, §4.15.

Technical Release attribute (T6): colour, dimensionality, and resolution
describe the manifestation, not the canonical Work. Routing-family (A6) —
excluded from ``work_hash`` / ``release_hash`` and from ``compare_signals``.

Distinct from the free-text ``source_format`` (which names the distribution
container/capture, e.g. "Blu-ray", "Vinyl", "35mm"): a Blu-ray can ship a
black-and-white silent film just as a 4K stream can.
