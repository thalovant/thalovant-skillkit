"""The session an utterance is being processed on, for as long as that utterance lasts.

OVOS-SESSION-2 §2.2 lets the orchestrator keep a transient cache of the
session it is currently processing and forbids anything from treating such a
cache as durable state. This module is that cache, and the whole of it.

The working session is registered when an utterance enters the lifecycle
(OVOS-PIPELINE-1 §6) and dropped when the lifecycle terminates. It is keyed on
the §9.1.1 ``utterance_id``, which every Message derived from the utterance
carries, so a handler frame or a legacy context write arriving mid-round finds
the same object the pipeline is working on, and nothing survives its round.

Named sessions are why this exists. The orchestrator holds no state for them
between utterances (§2.2), so ``SessionManager.sessions`` never contains one
and a lookup there answers ``None``; the round's session lives here instead.
For the default session the working session *is* the store (§5), so a lookup
here and ``SessionManager.get_default_session()`` return the same object and
either answer is correct.

A message with no ``utterance_id`` belongs to no lifecycle. There is no
working session for it — per §2.6 an out-of-lifecycle write has nowhere
legitimate to land — and callers get ``None``.
