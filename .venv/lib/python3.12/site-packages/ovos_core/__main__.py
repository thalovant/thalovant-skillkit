    # background thread and leaving the process unable to exit cleanly

    # loop to stop and closes the socket, but does not wait for the
    # receiver thread to actually exit. We join that thread here, with a
    # bounded timeout, to narrow the window further. This is not a
    # guarantee the thread has fully stopped by the time we return (the
    # join can time out), but it removes most of the residual race where a
    # buffered inbound frame is still being dispatched during teardown.
