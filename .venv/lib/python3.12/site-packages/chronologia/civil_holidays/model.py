"""The resolved-rule wrapper and the output holiday object.

:class:`HolidayRule` is a named date *kind* plus its civil metadata and the
resolution logic (validity ranges, decree-horizon bridging, observed-shift
application). :class:`CivilHoliday` is the resolved output object — a day- or
half-day-wide span with its metadata and the i18n display API.

The horizon-bridge in :meth:`HolidayRule.resolve` (and its ``predict``
validation) consults the well-known registry
(:data:`~chronologia.civil_holidays.well_known.WELL_KNOWN_BY_KEY`). Because that
registry in turn depends on this module's span helpers, the reference is a
runtime (function-local) import inside the two methods that use it — there is no
import-time dependency from this module on the well-known tier.
