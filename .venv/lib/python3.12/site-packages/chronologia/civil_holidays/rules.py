"""Per-kind frozen rule classes — a tagged union of holiday date kinds.

Each *kind* of rule is its own frozen dataclass exposing one method,
``observances(year) -> tuple[(AstroDate, basis), ...]``. Per-kind classes are
preferred over a single class with a ``kind`` tag and a bag of optional fields:
every field a kind carries is mandatory *for that kind* and self-validating, so
an ill-formed rule cannot be constructed, and dispatch is ordinary Python
polymorphism rather than a ``match`` on a string tag.

This module also carries the documented :data:`CATEGORIES` schema and
:func:`parse_name_cell` (the ``.tab`` name-cell splitter), the lowest-dependency
facts every other part of the engine builds on.
