"""Globally well-known holidays — the set a *language* binds for NL reference.

The movable/religious/civil set a *language* binds for natural-language
reference ("christmas", "when is easter", "next christmas").  This is
deliberately NOT "every rule in all 45 jurisdictions": it is a small, curated
set of holidays that are well-known *across* borders, each anchored to one
jurisdiction whose data file already carries its rule and its official name.
Behaviour (the date math) stays in the rule kinds; the surfaces a language
speaks are FACTS harvested at load time from the engine's existing i18n tables
(official native names + ``translations.tab``) plus a curated spoken-alias table
(``i18n/well_known.tab``) — never a giant hand-authored per-language vocabulary
file.

The second tier (:class:`JurisdictionKnownHoliday`) carries the holidays whose
rule only picks out a date once a jurisdiction is assumed (Mother's / Father's
Day differ per country), keyed by ``(key, lang)``.
