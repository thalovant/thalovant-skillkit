"""Cosmological reckoning: span-valued epochs and parameter-set variants.

Deep-time on Earth (:mod:`chronologia.periods`, :func:`chronologia.eras.resolve_bp`)
already places million- and billion-year dates on the Before-Present axis with
their uncertainty carried as span *width*.  Cosmology pushes two things past
what that machinery assumed, and this module adds exactly those two mechanisms:

1. **Span-valued era epochs** (:class:`UncertainEra`).  Every earthly epoch is a
   fixed instant; the Big Bang is not.  Its position — 13.787 ± 0.020 Gyr
   before present (Planck 2018) — is *itself* an interval, so an era counted
   from it must propagate the epoch's own uncertainty into every date it
   resolves.  :func:`resolve_cosmic` does this by **interval arithmetic**: the
   epoch's ±20 Myr and the value's significant-figure width simply **add**
   (Section "combination rule" below).

2. **Cosmology parameter-set variants** (:class:`CosmologyParams`).  Converting
   a redshift to a lookback time is not a single computation — it depends on the
   Hubble constant, which two careful measurements disagree about (the *Hubble
   tension*): Planck's CMB value 67.4 and the SH0ES local distance-ladder value
   73.04 km/s/Mpc.  Rather than pick a winner, the library **ships both as named
   variants** and makes :func:`lookback_time` take a ``cosmology=`` argument, so
   the disagreement is expressed by calling it twice.
