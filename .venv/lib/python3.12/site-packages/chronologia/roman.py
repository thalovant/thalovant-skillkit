"""Roman calendar day reckoning: Kalends, Nones and Ides.

The Romans named a day by *inclusive backward counting* from the next of
three monthly anchor days:

* **Kalends** (Kalendae) -- the 1st of the month;
* **Nones** (Nonae) -- the 5th, or the 7th in March, May, July, October;
* **Ides** (Idus) -- the 13th, or the 15th in those same four months.

"ante diem III Kalendas Aprilis" (a.d. III Kal. Apr.) is the 3rd day
before the Kalends of April counting inclusively: 1 April is day 1,
31 March day 2, 30 March day 3 -> 30 March.  "pridie" ("the day before")
is the count-2 case; the bare ablative ("Idibus Martiis", on the Ides) is
the anchor day itself (count 1).

The arithmetic is over the **Julian** calendar (the calendar actually in
use), through ``calendars.julian_to_jdn`` / ``jdn_to_julian``; the returned
``(year, month, day)`` is the Julian-calendar date, so 30 March reads as
month 3 day 30 -- the Roman date's own labels, not a Gregorian shift.

SIMPLIFICATION (documented): in a leap year February is reckoned with the
**proleptic-Julian** intercalation -- the extra day is 29 February, appended
to the end of the month -- rather than the authentic Roman *bissextum*, which
doubled ``a.d. VI Kalendas Martias`` (24 February) and named both the 24th and
the intercalary day "a.d. VI". As a result the ante-diem count for dates in
leap-year February follows the modern proleptic-Julian day-count, not the
historical doubled-day scheme (which cannot map to a single ``(y, m, d)``
anyway). Common years and every other month are unaffected.

Ides); "Julian calendar" (the bissextile intercalation).
