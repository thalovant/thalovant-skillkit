"""Temporal granularity enumeration.

``DateTimeResolution`` names the granularity ("width") of a temporal
reference: a day, a week, a month, a year, a decade, a century, a
millennium, a count backwards from the before-present epoch, or — for
deep time — a geological epoch, period, era or eon.

In chronologia the resolution is *derived*, never asserted: a
:class:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan` computes its own resolution from
the width of its half-open interval. This enum is the vocabulary that
derivation reports.

Provenance: extracted verbatim (enum members and their integer values
unchanged) from ``ovos_date_parser.ranges``. Only the closed set of
members needed by the reckoning core is vendored here; the surrounding
range/season utilities of that module deliberately stay behind, as they
carry parser-only dependencies.

class DateTimeResolution(Enum):
    """Granularity of a temporal reference.

    ``UNIT`` counts from the start of the calendar (ordinal 1 = year 1);
    ``UNIT_OF_SCOPE`` counts inside the scope containing the reference
    date; ``BEFORE_PRESENT_UNIT`` counts backwards from the before-present
    reference epoch (January 1st 1950, as in radiocarbon dating).

    Not every member is *emitted* by :attr:`DateSpan.resolution`. Width
    derivation reports only the plain magnitude tiers -- ``DAY``, ``WEEK``,
    ``MONTH``, ``YEAR``, ``DECADE``, ``CENTURY``, ``MILLENNIUM`` and the
    deep-time tiers (``PERIOD_GEOLOGICAL`` .. ``EON``) -- because a bare width
    cannot tell a calendar-aligned week from an arbitrary seven-day span. The
    compound ``UNIT_OF_SCOPE`` and ``BEFORE_PRESENT_UNIT`` members are a
    *classification and input vocabulary*: callers pass them in to compute a
    scoped or before-present range (see
    :mod:`chronologia.extract.ranges`), and scoped-ordinal resolution names
    them explicitly. They are a legitimate part of the public enum, just not
    values ``DateSpan.resolution`` derives from width alone.
