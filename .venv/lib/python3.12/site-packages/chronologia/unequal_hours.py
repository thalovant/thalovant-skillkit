"""Unequal (temporal / seasonal) hours and clock-count conventions.

Before mechanical clocks imposed a steady 60-minute hour, most of the
pre-modern world divided *daylight* into a fixed count of hours and *night*
into another.  The count was constant; the hour's length was not.  A daytime
hour stretched in summer, when the sun was up for longer, and shrank in winter
-- at Rome's latitude (about 41.9 degrees north) a Roman daytime hour ran to
roughly 76 minutes at the June solstice and shrank to about 46 minutes at the
December solstice, while the night hours did the mirror-opposite.  These are
**proportional** or **temporal** (also *seasonal*) hours.

This module builds those hours on top of :mod:`chronologia.solar`.  The
daylight span (sunrise to sunset, or a twilight-anchored variant) is divided
into the system's ``day_hours``; the night span (sunset to the next sunrise)
into its ``night_hours``.  Each unequal hour is returned as a
:class:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan` whose ``width`` *is* the actual,
date- and latitude-varying length of that hour.

Two families are provided:

* **Proportional-hour systems** (:class:`UnequalHourSystem`,
  :func:`temporal_hour_span`) -- Roman/medieval 12+12 temporal hours, Jewish
  *sha'ot zmaniyot* (GRA), and Edo-period Japanese 6+6 hours.
* **Clock-count conventions** (:class:`ClockConvention`,
  :func:`convention_time`) -- *equal*-hour counts re-anchored to a solar
  event: Italian hours counted 1..24 from sunset, Babylonian hours counted
  from sunrise.

**Basis.**  Every span/instant produced here inherits the class-B accuracy of
:mod:`chronologia.solar` -- the NOAA arithmetic sunrise/sunset is
convention-bearing, not an ephemeris (``SOLAR_ACCURACY`` bounds it to about a
minute for 1901..2099).  Proportional-hour spans are therefore built with
``basis="tabulated"``: their endpoints come from a deterministic solar model
that may differ from a precise observation.

**Polar honesty (typed pass-through).**  When the solar anchor an unequal hour
needs does not occur -- the sun never rises or never sets that day --
:func:`sun_events` returns a :class:`~chronologia.solar.NoSunEvent`.  This
module never raises and never fabricates a time in that case: it returns the
very :class:`NoSunEvent` it received, so polar conditions propagate as data.

**Magen Avraham zmanim -- omitted, on purpose.**  The GRA reckons the twelve
*sha'ot zmaniyot* from sunrise (*netz*) to sunset (*shkia*), which maps
exactly onto :func:`sun_events`' ``sunrise``/``sunset``.  The competing Magen
Avraham reckoning runs from *alot hashachar* to *tzeit hakochavim* -- dawn and
nightfall -- standardly fixed at solar depressions of 16.1 degrees (alot) and
8.5 degrees (tzeit), or the equivalent fixed 72 minutes.  :mod:`chronologia.solar`
exposes only the 6 / 12 / 18-degree civil / nautical / astronomical twilights;
none of those angles is the Magen Avraham definition, so treating civil dawn
(6 degrees) as *alot* would be a fabricated equivalence, not a cited one.
Rather than ship a mislabelled proxy, the Magen Avraham system is omitted until
solar.py can produce a 16.1 / 8.5-degree crossing.  The ``day_anchor`` field
below is nonetheless kept general (it accepts ``"civil_dawn"``) so the twilight
-anchored shape is expressible the moment a citable clean mapping exists.

Sources are cited per system in the ``citations`` / ``citation`` fields and in
``test/test_unequal_hours.py``.
