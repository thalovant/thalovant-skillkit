"""Equinoxes, solstices, astronomical seasons and the 24 solar terms.

The instants of the equinoxes and solstices, the astronomical season spans
they bound, and the Chinese *jieqi* (24 solar terms) all come from **mean
orbital theory** -- closed-form arithmetic on mean elements, not a full
ephemeris integration (the package's no-ephemeris scope, shared with
:mod:`chronologia.moon`).  Like moon phases this is exact arithmetic on an
approximate model: the model carries the error, not the computation, so every
result is a :class:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan` whose width is the stated
accuracy and whose :attr:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan.basis` records that
it is a reconstruction from theory rather than an observation.

**Sources (cited)**:

* Jean Meeus,
  *Astronomical Algorithms* (2nd ed., 1998, Willmann-Bell), chapter 27
  "Equinoxes and Solstices", reproduced verbatim in the open-source
  AstroAlgorithms4Python ``equinox.py``.  Carries the full coefficient set
  transcribed below: the JDE0 mean-equinox polynomial for the ``+1000..+3000``
  range (table 27.B, all four cardinal events, ``Y=(year-2000)/1000``), the
  24-row periodic-terms table (27.C: :data:`_TERMS`), and the correction
  ``W = 35999.373*T - 2.47`` deg with
  ``dl = 1 + 0.0334*cos W + 0.0007*cos 2W`` and
  ``JDE = JDE0 + 0.00001*S/dl`` where ``S`` sums the periodic terms.
* ``meeus_equinox_solstice_stellafane.html`` -- Stellafane "Equinox & Solstice
  Calculator", which implements the same method and states the accuracy
  verbatim: **"error is less than one minute for the years 1951-2050"**, valid
  year range **1000 to 3000**, output in **TDT** (Terrestrial Dynamical Time
  ~ TT).  That one-minute figure is :data:`EQUINOX_ACCURACY`; the 1000..3000
  range is :data:`VALID_YEAR_RANGE` (a ``ValueError`` outside it, since the
  27.B polynomial is not fitted there and no 27.A table is transcribed here).
* ``equinoxes_solstices_2001-2100_astropixels.html`` -- Fred Espenak /
  AstroPixels published Universal-Time equinox/solstice table, the gold set
  cross-checked in ``test/test_equinoxes.py``.

**Accuracy -- equinoxes/solstices.**  :data:`EQUINOX_ACCURACY` == 1 minute
(Meeus/Stellafane's stated bound over 1951-2050; it degrades gently toward the
1000..3000 range edges but stays close to a minute, hence the single stated
bound over the whole valid range).

**Accuracy -- solar terms.**  The intermediate 15-degree crossings are NOT
covered by the 27.B cardinal-point polynomial; they are found instead by
inverting Meeus's *low-accuracy* Sun longitude (chapter 25 -- mean longitude
plus the equation of the centre, :func:`_sun_apparent_longitude`), which Meeus
states is good to about ``0.01`` degrees.  At the Sun's ~``0.9856`` deg/day
mean rate that is ~15 minutes of time; adding the nutation term this module
omits (~``0.004`` deg ~ 6 min) and mean-element slack, :data:`SOLAR_TERM_ACCURACY`
is set to **30 minutes** -- honestly wider than the cardinal equinoxes.  This
is the class-B improvement path for the Chinese-calendar family: it gives the
*jieqi* to the half-minute-of-arc, but it **does not upgrade the Chinese
calendar itself** (:mod:`chronologia.calendars`), whose tabulated
month/leap-month structure stays authoritative -- a mean-longitude term instant
is not a substitute for the table's true-longitude astronomical basis.

**TT -> UTC.**  Meeus's result is in TT (dynamical time).  Where the
leap-second table applies (1972 onward, :mod:`chronologia.leapseconds`) the
instant is converted to civil UTC via :func:`~chronologia.leapseconds.tt_to_utc`
(``TT - UTC = utc_tai_offset + 32.184 s``, and beyond the table's confirmed
horizon the last offset is held constant -- the leapseconds module's own
documented predicted basis).  **Before 1972** the leap-second machinery is out
of scope (fractional "rubber seconds"), so the TT instant is returned
unconverted and labelled as such; the residual ``TT - UTC`` there is bounded by
Delta-T, well under the seasonal spacing this module reports and far under a
day.

**Basis.**  Every returned :class:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan` carries
``basis="reconstructed"`` -- the same peer basis :mod:`chronologia.moon` uses
for an already-modelled instant, chosen here for the same reason: these are
closed-form arithmetic reconstructions of an astronomical truth from mean
orbital theory.  Unlike :func:`chronologia.moon.next_phase`, these functions
take a *year*, not a caller "now" anchor, so there is no past/future instant to
split ``reconstructed`` from ``predicted`` on; the two are lattice peers of
equal rank (:func:`~chronologia.astrodate.combine_basis`), so the single
``reconstructed`` label composes identically either way.

**Meteorological vs astronomical seasons.**  :func:`astronomical_season_span`
returns the equinox-to-solstice spans -- the astronomical convention.  This is
deliberately the *alternative* to the meteorological seasons used elsewhere
(fixed three-month blocks starting on the first of March/June/September/
December, convenient for climate statistics).  Both conventions are in common
use; the astronomical one ties each season to a real solar event, the
meteorological one to whole calendar months.  See ``docs/sun-moon-and-seasons.md``.

    early February; index 3 == ``"chunfen"``, the March equinox at longitude
    0 deg).  Returns a :class:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan` of width
    ``2 * SOLAR_TERM_ACCURACY`` centred on the mean-longitude instant, in
    civil UTC (TT before 1972), ``basis="reconstructed"``.

    Found by inverting Meeus's low-accuracy Sun longitude, so this is the
    class-B improvement path for the Chinese-calendar family -- accurate to
    :data:`SOLAR_TERM_ACCURACY`, deliberately wider than the cardinal
    equinoxes.  It **does not** upgrade :mod:`chronologia.calendars`'s Chinese
    calendar, whose tabulated structure stays authoritative (module docstring).
