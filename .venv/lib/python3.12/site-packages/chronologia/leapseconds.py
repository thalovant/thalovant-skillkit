"""Leap seconds: UTC <-> TAI <-> GPS conversions on the real (non-POSIX) timescales.

UTC keeps pace with the earth's uneven rotation by inserting occasional
whole leap seconds; TAI (International Atomic Time) and GPS time do not —
they tick continuously from their own epochs. The cumulative offset between
UTC and TAI is therefore not a formula, it is *history*: a tabulated,
periodically-updated fact published by the IERS (Bulletin C) and mirrored
by IANA/IETF as ``leap-seconds.list``. This module ships a parsed copy of
that table (:mod:`chronologia.data`, ``leap_seconds.tab``) with a provenance
header, exposes it as :data:`LEAP_SECONDS`, and provides the conversions.

POSIX/unix time (``chronologia.eras``' ``"unix"`` era, ``time.time()``,
``datetime.timestamp()``) counts **86400 seconds per day, every day** — it
never sees a leap second and is not "smeared" or corrected here in any way.
Unix time and its era in :mod:`chronologia.eras` are simply a different,
leap-second-*agnostic* timescale from the ones in this module; converting
between them and TAI/GPS is out of scope (POSIX itself does not define
what a unix timestamp means across a leap second, so no such conversion
would be well-defined without picking a smearing scheme, e.g. Google/AWS
"leap smear", which this module does not implement or endorse).

Naive-input convention: a naive ``datetime``/``date``/:class:`AstroDate`
passed to any function here is treated as already being UTC (this mirrors
the convention used elsewhere in ``chronologia``, e.g. ``eras.py``'s
"unix" era). An aware ``datetime`` is converted to UTC first via
``astimezone``.

Scope boundaries:

- **Pre-1972**: out of scope. Before 1972-01-01 UTC ran on the "rubber
  second" system (fractional, continuously-adjusted UTC-UT1 corrections,
  not whole leap seconds) — a fundamentally different mechanism that would
  need its own cited table. Calling any function here with an instant
  before 1972-01-01 raises ``ValueError``.
- **Beyond the table**: the table is complete only through
  :data:`TABLE_VALID_UNTIL` (the source list's stated expiry — IERS
  Bulletin C announces a new leap second roughly six months ahead of it,
  so the table can always be trusted at least that far past "today").
  Instants beyond that date are still accepted, but the offset returned
  for them is a **predicted basis**: the last known cumulative offset,
  assumed constant (i.e. "no further leap second has been announced yet"),
  not a guarantee that none will occur.
