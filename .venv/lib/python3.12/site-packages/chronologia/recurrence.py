"""RFC 5545 recurrence rules (RRULE) over the Julian-Day-Number hub.

A calendar-recurrence engine — "every third Tuesday", "the last Monday of
May", "Friday the 13th" — expressed with the vocabulary of
:rfc:`5545#section-3.3.10` (the iCalendar ``RECUR`` value type) and evaluated
by pure integer arithmetic on :class:`~chronologia.astrodate.AstroDate` /
:class:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan`.  Because expansion is nothing but
Julian-Day-Number math, a yearly rule iterates just as happily from the year
-500 as from 2025: there is no ``datetime`` window and nothing overflows.

Scope — date parts, plus a clock pin (``BYHOUR`` / ``BYMINUTE``)
---------------------------------------------------------------
This engine implements the *date*-generating rule parts of RFC 5545:

    ``FREQ`` (``DAILY`` / ``WEEKLY`` / ``MONTHLY`` / ``YEARLY``), ``INTERVAL``,
    ``COUNT``, ``UNTIL``, ``BYMONTH``, ``BYWEEKNO``, ``BYYEARDAY``,
    ``BYMONTHDAY``, ``BYDAY`` (including ordinals such as ``1MO`` / ``-1FR``),
    ``BYSETPOS`` and ``WKST``.

On top of that date skeleton it accepts a **time-of-day pin** — ``BYHOUR`` and
``BYMINUTE`` — so a civil rule spoken with a clock ("daily at 9", "every
Wednesday at 9:30") keeps its hour.  When neither is present each occurrence is
a whole day (a day-wide :class:`DateSpan`), exactly as before; when ``BYHOUR``
is present each matched day expands to that clock time, a one-hour span (or a
one-minute span when ``BYMINUTE`` is also given).  The genuinely **sub-day
frequencies** — ``FREQ=SECONDLY`` / ``MINUTELY`` / ``HOURLY`` — and
``BYSECOND`` remain **out of scope** (a within-day *frequency* has no meaning
for a civil calendar rule); parsing any of those still raises ``ValueError``
rather than silently dropping it.

DTSTART semantics — **strict RFC, not dateutil-compatible**
-----------------------------------------------------------
The recurrence set contains ``DTSTART`` **only if ``DTSTART`` itself matches
the rule**.  This is the strict reading of RFC 5545 (§3.8.5.3: "The recurrence
set ... is the complete set of recurrence instances for a calendar component,
as defined by the ... 'RRULE' ... The 'DTSTART' property ... MUST be
synchronized with the recurrence rule, if specified.").  It differs from
``python-dateutil``, which unconditionally prepends ``DTSTART`` even when it
does not satisfy the rule.  Concretely, with ``DTSTART`` on a Wednesday and
``FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO`` this engine yields only Mondays; dateutil would emit
the seed Wednesday first.  ``DTSTART`` is still the anchor that fixes the
interval phase and supplies defaults for absent rule parts — it just is not
force-included.

Unbounded rules
---------------
:func:`occurrences` refuses to enumerate an unbounded set: if neither the rule
(``COUNT`` / ``UNTIL``) nor the call (``count=`` / ``until=``) bounds it, it
raises ``ValueError``.  An infinite ``for`` loop over a "forever" rule is
therefore impossible by accident; ask for a ``count`` or an ``until``.

Citations
---------
IETF RFC 5545 §3.3.10 (RECUR grammar, the expand/limit dependency table and the
BYDAY notes) and §3.8.5.3 (the worked example corpus).  The enumerated example
dates seed the gold test suite.

#: the authoritative guard: COUNT is only one of several ways an expansion can
#: turn expensive (a small/absent COUNT with a far ``UNTIL``, or a call-level

#: memory/time cost of materialisation: a rule with a small or absent COUNT
#: but a distant ``UNTIL`` (or a caller-supplied ``count=``/``until=`` that
#: bypasses the declared-COUNT fast-path above) is just as able to blow up

    """"Every holiday in ``jurisdiction``" -- a whole calendar's holiday set.

    Unlike :class:`HolidayRecurrence` (one *named* movable feast, expanded year
    by year), this is *every* holiday a jurisdiction observes in a given year,
    re-queried from :mod:`chronologia.civil_holidays` per year and flattened
    into a single chronological stream. "Holiday" plainly means the public
    holidays (bank/statutory closures) unless the caller asks for more, so
    ``categories`` defaults to ``("public",)`` -- pass e.g.
    ``("public", "bank")`` for a wider set, or any subset the jurisdiction's
    data supports.

    ``jurisdiction`` is an upper-cased ISO-3166-1 (or vacanza market) code,
    e.g. ``"PT"``; ``subdiv`` optionally scopes to a subdivision (``"PT-LIS"``)
    the same way :func:`~chronologia.civil_holidays.holidays_for` does.

    Like :class:`HolidayRecurrence`, this has **no RFC 5545 rule** -- a
    jurisdiction's holiday calendar is not ``BY*`` arithmetic, it is a lookup
    -- so :meth:`to_string` raises rather than emit a lie.
