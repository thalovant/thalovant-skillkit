"""Day-part registry: named stretches *within* a civil day, resolved to spans.

A :class:`DayPart` binds a human name for a portion of the day ("morning",
"tarde") to a start and end **time-of-day** (a day fraction: 06:00 is a quarter
of the way through the day), tagged with an optional *lang* (``None`` == the
global default convention) and a versioned *source*.  Applied to a concrete
civil date by :func:`daypart_span`, it becomes a :class:`DateSpan` — the same
half-open interval type every other reckoning layer produces.

The golden rule this module teaches: **a day-part is a convention, and
conventions differ.**  "Morning" is not a fact about the sun; it is a boundary
a culture draws, and different cultures draw it differently.  English splits the
post-noon day into *afternoon* and *evening*; Spanish runs one *tarde* straight
across both.  So the boundaries are *data*, language-tagged exactly like the
region-tagged named periods in :mod:`chronologia.periods`, never hard-coded
engine logic.

Why the tag is a *language*, not a region
-----------------------------------------
It says ``lang`` because a language is what it is.  ``tarde`` is Spanish, and
it is Spanish in Madrid, Lima and Los Angeles alike; nothing about the entry is
geographic, and calling the tag a region invited the reader to think a
Spanish-speaker in Texas somehow gets the English bands.  :mod:`periods` keeps
``region`` because *its* tag really is geographic — the British bronze age is
not the Chinese one.  The old ``region`` spelling stays available on
:class:`DayPart`, :func:`lookup` and :func:`daypart_span` as a documented
alias, because :data:`DAY_PARTS` and both functions are public API and a rename
must not break a caller who wrote ``region="es"`` while the name was wrong.
Genuine geographic variation within one language can be layered on the day it
is actually needed; it is not modelled now.

Canonical source
----------------
The per-language boundaries are the **Unicode CLDR Day Period Rules** (TR35 /
CLDR 47), the machine-readable authority for locale-specific day periods —
precisely because it encodes that these boundaries vary by locale.  A copy of
the chart lives in the papers library
(``standards/cldr47_day_period_rules.html``) and every language row below is
transcribed from it.

The **default** set (lang ``None``) is *not* CLDR, and earlier versions of this
docstring were wrong to say it was.  CLDR's ``en`` rows run ``morning1`` from
00:00 and place no band before it; chronologia's default starts morning at
06:00 and runs a ``night`` that wraps 21:00 → 06:00.  That is chronologia's own
English convention — the reading an English speaker means by "this morning" and
"tonight" — and it is what the library has always shipped.  It is kept as-is
deliberately: changing it would silently move every English span already in
use.  The honest description is therefore "chronologia's English convention,
which departs from CLDR ``en`` at the morning start and in wrapping night", and
the CLDR citation is reserved for the per-language rows, where it is exact.

Default convention (lang ``None``), chronologia's own English convention:

============ =============== ==================
day-part     interval        note
============ =============== ==================
``morning``  ``[06:00, 12:00)``
``afternoon`` ``[12:00, 18:00)``
``evening``  ``[18:00, 21:00)``
``night``    ``[21:00, 06:00)`` crosses midnight
``noon``     ``[12:00, 12:01)`` minimal-width anchor
``midnight`` ``[00:00, 00:01)`` minimal-width anchor
============ =============== ==================

Reading CLDR's rows into spans
------------------------------
CLDR states a day period as a *start time* and lets the next row's start close
it, so a locale's rows are a cyclic partition of the 24 hours.  Transcribing
that mechanically gives every band ``[own start, next start)``, with the last
row of the day closing at 24:00.  One rule handles the wrap, and it is applied
uniformly: **when the same period name occupies both the first row (anchored at
00:00) and the last row, the two rows are one band and are joined into a single
midnight-crossing span.**  Romanian is the case that shows it — ``noapte``
appears at 00:00 *and* at 22:00, one night split by the chart's own
start-time-only notation, so it is stored once as ``[22:00, 05:00)``.

Where the names differ, the rows are left apart.  Italian ``sera`` closes at
24:00 and ``notte`` opens at 00:00, so ``notte`` is ``[00:00, 06:00)`` — the
small hours — and is *not* re-cut into an English-shaped night beginning the
previous evening.  That is the whole point of transcribing rather than
translating: English's night wraps because English's night wraps, and Italian's
does not have to.

Per-language conventions, all from the CLDR 47 chart above:

* ``es`` madrugada ``[00:00, 06:00)``, mañana ``[06:00, 12:00)``, tarde
  ``[12:00, 20:00)``, noche ``[20:00, 24:00)`` — one *tarde* across what
  English calls afternoon *and* early evening.
* ``pt`` madrugada ``[00:00, 06:00)``, manhã ``[06:00, 12:00)``, tarde
  ``[12:00, 19:00)``, noite ``[19:00, 24:00)``.
* ``ca`` matinada ``[00:00, 06:00)``, matí ``[06:00, 12:00)``, migdia
  ``[12:00, 13:00)``, tarda ``[13:00, 19:00)``, vespre ``[19:00, 21:00)``, nit
  ``[21:00, 24:00)``.
* ``gl`` madrugada ``[00:00, 06:00)``, mañá ``[06:00, 12:00)``, mediodía
  ``[12:00, 13:00)``, tarde ``[13:00, 21:00)``, noite ``[21:00, 24:00)``.
* ``fr`` nuit ``[00:00, 04:00)``, matin ``[04:00, 12:00)``, après-midi
  ``[12:00, 18:00)``, soir ``[18:00, 24:00)``.
* ``it`` notte ``[00:00, 06:00)``, mattina ``[06:00, 12:00)``, pomeriggio
  ``[12:00, 18:00)``, sera ``[18:00, 24:00)``.
* ``ro`` noapte ``[22:00, 05:00)`` (the joined wrap), dimineață
  ``[05:00, 12:00)``, după-amiază ``[12:00, 18:00)``, seară ``[18:00, 22:00)``.
* ``de`` Nacht ``[00:00, 05:00)``, Morgen ``[05:00, 10:00)``, Vormittag
  ``[10:00, 12:00)``, Mittag ``[12:00, 13:00)``, Nachmittag ``[13:00, 18:00)``,
  Abend ``[18:00, 24:00)`` — six bands, none of which is English's afternoon.
* ``nl`` nacht ``[00:00, 06:00)``, ochtend ``[06:00, 12:00)``, middag
  ``[12:00, 18:00)``, avond ``[18:00, 24:00)``.
* ``sv`` natt ``[00:00, 05:00)``, morgon ``[05:00, 10:00)``, förmiddag
  ``[10:00, 12:00)``, eftermiddag ``[12:00, 18:00)``, kväll
  ``[18:00, 24:00)``.
* ``da`` nat ``[00:00, 05:00)``, morgen ``[05:00, 10:00)``, formiddag
  ``[10:00, 12:00)``, eftermiddag ``[12:00, 18:00)``, aften ``[18:00, 24:00)``.
* ``nb``/``nn`` natt ``[00:00, 06:00)``, morgen/morgon ``[06:00, 10:00)``,
  formiddag/føremiddag ``[10:00, 12:00)``, ettermiddag ``[12:00, 18:00)``,
  kveld ``[18:00, 24:00)``.

Further locales (``ar az bg cs el et eu fa he hr hu id is ms pl sk sl
tr uk``) are transcribed the same way, but collapsed into chronologia's own
four-band model — ``morning`` (CLDR morning1+morning2), ``afternoon``
(afternoon1/2), ``evening`` (evening1) and ``night`` (night1, joined with a
00:00 night2 into one midnight-crossing band) — because these locales are
consumed through the deictic ``daypart_ref`` grammar ("this morning",
"yesterday evening"), which speaks that four-band vocabulary.  The bands are
always shipped; a band whose only natural surface is multi-word (Czech ``v
noci``, Polish ``po południu``, Turkish ``öğleden sonra``, Malay ``tengah
hari``) carries no ``daypart_*.voc`` yet -- French ``après-midi`` ships its
tokenizer-canonicalised "après midi" surface, so it no longer belongs to that
set -- and ``az`` ships the bands but holds its surfaces for native review.

``Vormittag``, ``förmiddag``, ``formiddag``, ``føremiddag`` and ``migdia`` have
no English name at all, which is why they are stored under their own names
rather than folded into ``morning`` or ``noon``.  Inventing an English label
for a band English does not have would be the same mistake as assuming English's
hours.

Lookup falls back from a language to the global default: asking for ``morning``
in ``es`` yields the default morning (Spanish contributes ``tarde``, not a
``morning`` override); asking for ``tarde`` with no language raises, since
``tarde`` is not a global name.

    clock reading.  Either way, the boundary is always a single, well-defined

    """The span a day-part occupies on a concrete date.

    ``lang`` selects a language's own carve-up of the day ("tarde" in ``es``
    runs to 20:00); omitted, the global default set applies.  ``region`` is the
    old spelling of ``lang`` and still works, as on :func:`lookup`.

    ``date_or_span`` supplies the civil date to anchor to — an
    :class:`AstroDate`/``date``/``datetime`` names the day directly; a
    :class:`DateSpan` contributes the civil date of its ``start``.

    A midnight-crosser anchors to the *named* date and reaches into the next
    civil day: ``daypart_span(tuesday, "night")`` is Tue 21:00 → **Wed** 06:00
    (the documented convention — "tuesday night" belongs to Tuesday even though
    it ends on Wednesday).

    When ``date_or_span`` is itself a :class:`DateSpan`, the result is
    *composed* with it via :meth:`DateSpan.intersect` — ``daypart_span(some_day,
    "morning")`` returns morning clipped to that day-span, so applying a
    day-part to "tuesday" and to a truncated slice of Tuesday differ exactly by
    the overlap.  A day-part disjoint from the given span raises
    :class:`ValueError`, since there is no interval to return.

    **``zone``.**  ``None`` (the default) keeps every endpoint a naive
    wall-clock reading, byte-identical to the library's behaviour before
    ``zone`` existed.  Given a ``tzinfo``, both endpoints become **aware**
    :class:`AstroDate` instants in that zone instead of bare wall-clock
    readings — resolved via
    :func:`~chronologia.astrodate.resolve_wall_clock`, so a boundary landing
    in a DST **gap** (spring-forward) or **fold** (fall-back) resolves
    deterministically to the *post-transition* instant (see
    :func:`_resolve_boundary`) rather than raising or guessing.  Because the
    two endpoints can therefore each pick up a different UTC offset across a
    transition, :attr:`DateSpan.width` on the result honestly reflects the
    real elapsed time -- 23 or 25 hours instead of the nominal 24 (or, for a
    day-part narrower than a full day, a similar hour thinner/thicker than its
    naive width) whenever the transition falls inside the part's boundaries.
