"""Computus: the date of Easter and the movable feasts reckoned from it.

Easter is the great *movable* feast: it is not a fixed calendar date but a
rule — the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon on or after
the (fixed) 21 March equinox.  Crucially the "full moon" here is **not** an
astronomical observation; it is a value read from a codified arithmetic lunar
table (the epact / golden-number cycle), so the whole computation is exact
integer arithmetic on a calendar, not ephemeris astronomy.  This module is
therefore class A (exact) rather than the mean-arithmetic class of
:mod:`chronologia.moon`: given a year it returns a *definite* date, no
accuracy bound.

East and West disagree for two independent reasons, and this module keeps
both: the West computes the rule on the **Gregorian** calendar with the
Gregorian lunar correction, while most of the Orthodox East still computes it
on the **Julian** calendar with the older Julian lunar table.  The two
calendars have drifted 13 days apart, and the two lunar tables differ as well,
so the Julian Easter usually falls one to five weeks after the Gregorian one —
occasionally they coincide (2025 is such a year).

**Sources (cited)**:

* Wikipedia, "Computus" (``Date_of_Easter``
  redirects here) — carries the two formulations transcribed below verbatim:
  the **"Anonymous Gregorian algorithm"** (also called the Meeus/Jones/Butcher
  algorithm, given by Jean Meeus in *Astronomical Algorithms* and traceable to
  a correspondent of *Nature*, 1876), which yields the Gregorian-calendar month
  and day of Western Easter; and **"Meeus's Julian algorithm"** (Meeus,
  *Astronomical Algorithms*), which yields the **Julian**-calendar month and
  day of Orthodox Easter.  Both are pure integer arithmetic.
* Wikipedia, "Moveable feast" and Wikipedia, "Liturgical year" — the
  liturgical-calendar references for the day-offsets of the feasts computed
  from Easter (Ash Wednesday "46 days before Easter", Ascension "40 days after"
  i.e. the 39-day offset counting Easter as day 0, Pentecost the seventh Sunday
  after Easter, etc.) and for the fixed solar feasts (Christmas 25 December,
  Epiphany 6 January, Assumption 15 August, All Saints 1 November).

**The three Easter renderings.**  :func:`easter` takes a ``method``:

* ``"gregorian"`` — Western Easter as a **proleptic-Gregorian instant**
  (:class:`AstroDate`).  The algorithm's output *is* a Gregorian date, so the
  fields are used directly; this is a real Sunday.
* ``"julian"`` — Orthodox Easter carrying its **own Julian-calendar label**:
  the ``month``/``day`` fields hold the Julian-calendar numbers straight from
  Meeus's Julian algorithm.  This is the date "in the Julian calendar" — the
  form an Orthodox almanac prints as *the* Paschal date.  Because those numbers
  are stuffed into an :class:`AstroDate` (which is otherwise proleptic
  Gregorian), the result is a **label, not the civil instant**: do not read its
  ``weekday()`` as a civil Sunday, and do not do day arithmetic on it directly.
  To recover the instant, feed it back through the Julian calendar, which is
  exactly what the next option does.
* ``"julian_gregorian_date"`` — the Orthodox-practice convenience: the same
  Julian Easter **rendered in the Gregorian civil calendar** (Julian label →
  JDN → Gregorian).  This is the day Orthodox Christians actually mark on a
  civil wall calendar, and it is a real Sunday instant.  For 2024 the ``julian``
  label is 22 April (Julian) and this rendering is 5 May (Gregorian).

The movable feasts (:func:`movable_feast`) are always offset from the **real
Sunday instant**, so for the Orthodox methods they are reckoned from the
``julian_gregorian_date`` rendering and returned as civil Gregorian instants.
