"""Regnal sequences: era numberings attached to a *succession of reigns*.

The fourth registry kind alongside counts, calendars and eras.  A
:class:`RegnalSequence` is an ordered list of named segments, each starting
on a Julian Day Number; a segment ends exactly where its successor begins,
so the reigns tile with no gap, and the final segment is open-ended.
"Reiwa 7" or "the 3rd year of Reiwa" resolves to the Gregorian year span
that regnal year occupies inside its segment.

Year-count convention (documented, per the Japanese case):

From Meiji 6 (1873) Japan adopted the Gregorian calendar and counts a
regnal year as a **Gregorian calendar year** incrementing on 1 January:
regnal year 1 is the (partial) calendar year of accession, year N is
Gregorian year ``accession_year + N - 1``.  The span is clamped to the
segment, so the accession year is bounded below by the accession date
(Reiwa 1 = 2019-05-01..2020-01-01) and the final year of a closed segment
is bounded above by the successor's accession (Meiji 45 =
2019... -> 1912-01-01..1912-07-30).  Before 1873 Japan used a lunisolar
calendar, so the clean Gregorian-year identity holds only from Meiji 6 on;
earlier Meiji years are approximate under this arithmetic model.

nengō).

    # attested high and low figure, which silently produced a
    # chronologically-impossible ordering (Horemheb before Tutankhamun).
    # This dataset drops that approach entirely: a ruler appears in a
    # variant's segment list **only** where that variant's figure for them
    # is directly attested, and is simply absent from a variant otherwise --
    # so the three sequences below have DIFFERENT ruler subsets and
    # different lengths, and every gap is called out in a comment rather
    # than silently papered over.
    #
    # Per-ruler sources (all en.wikipedia.org, fetched and quoted directly):
    #   - "Ahmose I": infobox labels 1570-1546 BC "(HC)" i.e. High
    #     Chronology explicitly; no comparably labeled Low figure found ->
    #     high only.
    #   - "Amenhotep I": infobox "1545-1526 BC (high chr.)" / "1525-1506 BC
    #     (low chr.)" -> both high and low attested.
    #   - "Thutmose I": main text names both "low chronology" (1506-1493 BC)
    #     and "high chronology" (1526-1513 BC) explicitly -> both attested.
    #   - "Thutmose III": main text names "Low Chronology" (1479-1425 BC,
    #     "the conventional Egyptian chronology... since the 1960s") and
    #     "High Chronology of Egypt" (1504-1450 BC) explicitly -> both
    #     attested.
    #   - "Amenhotep II": main text: "dating his accession to either 1427 BC
    #     in the low chronology, or in 1452 BC in the high chronology" ->
    #     both attested.
    #   - "Amenhotep III": infobox/main text name only a "Low Chronology"
    #     figure (1391-1353 BC); no comparably labeled High figure found ->
    #     low only.
    #   - Akhenaten, Tutankhamun: no article gives a chronology-labeled
    #     high/middle/low split (only a single unlabeled conventional
    #     range each) -> DROPPED from this dataset entirely; the gap they
    #     leave (between Amenhotep III and Ay, in every variant) is
    #     intentional, not an oversight.
    #   - "Ay (pharaoh)": main text gives three unlabeled reign options
    #     ("1323 and 1319 BC, 1327-1323 BC, or 1310-1306 BC"); only the
    #     "1323-1319 BC" option is used here, because it alone tiles
    #     exactly against Horemheb's directly-attested "(low chr.)" start
    #     of 1319 BC with no gap or overlap -- the other two options are
    #     left out rather than guessed into a bucket, per the ordering
    #     failure above -> low only.
    #   - "Horemheb": infobox "1319-1292 BC (low chr.)" explicitly -> low
    #     only.
    #   - "Ramesses II": the one ruler with all three named variants
    #     attested across sources -- 1304 BC (High), 1290 BC (Middle), and
