"""Romance-language spelled-number folding (an/ast/ca/es/fr/gl/it/mwl/oc/pt/ro).

Shared mechanism: the number-word set is read from ovos_number_parser's
``NumberVocabulary`` for the language, and a maximal run of those words
(joined by the language's "and" word) is folded to a single digit token via
``extract_number_<lang>`` (ordinals included).  Per-language wrappers add the
token-surgery a locale needs on top (elision splits, clock-notation folds,
fixed-idiom collapses, ordinal-fraction homograph licensing, and the
deep-time SCALE-frame licensing shared by every Romance locale).

Split out of ``numfold.py`` verbatim (behaviour-preserving refactor); shared
primitives (``NumberGrammar``/``make_fold``/``reindex``) come from
``numfold_engine``, and ordinal-pronouncer wrapping from ``numfold_ordinals``.

    Italian "prima" is at once the feminine ordinal "first" and the
    directional marker "before"; a blanket number-fold would erase the
    marker, a blanket blacklist would erase the ordinal.  The two readings
    are distinguishable by position, so "prima" is blacklisted from the
    general fold (see :func:`fold_it`) and licensed to the digit 1 *only*
    where it is the ordinal -- i.e. everywhere it is **not** in the offset
    frame.  It is the before-marker when it either

    * is immediately followed by a di-family preposition introducing the
      reference date ("prima **di** gennaio", "prima **del** 5 aprile"), or
    * is immediately followed by a bare written year ("prima **2030**") --
      the connector-less counterpart of the di-family form, the same
      preposition-optional shape every other before-marker locale accepts
      (en "before 2030", es "antes de 2030"), or
    * closes a ``[NUM] UNIT`` duration ("3 giorni **prima** del ...",
      "tre giorni **prima** ...") -- the token before it a (non-number) unit
      word, the one before that a number;

    and the ordinal "first" otherwise ("**prima** settimana", "la **prima**
    domenica", "**prima** quindicina"), where it folds to 1 so the ordinal
    constructions bind it.  The rule keys off the preposition and the
    NUM+UNIT shape, never a hard-coded month or unit list, so it generalises.

# denominator of the same value -- "tredicesimo" is at once "thirteenth" and
# "a-thirteenth" (vocab.FRACTION[13] == vocab.ORDINAL_TENS would list it too,
# but ORDINAL_TENS only carries the round-ten entries 10/20/../90, so this
# homograph collision is invisible to the shared TENS mechanism and must be
# named explicitly).  Without licensing, "undicesimo".."diciannovesimo" are
# simply absent from the number-fold's word set (silently dropped as
# fractions), so a phrase built on one -- "il tredicesimo mese del 2026" --
# never tokenizes an ordinal at all and falls through to a bare year_ref
# match, same failure mode as the Spanish/Catalan compound gap this change
# closes.  Licensed positionally (after a definite article / before the
# quarter noun) exactly like the 1st-9th homographs above -- each is a
# complete single-word ordinal with no further composition, so (unlike the
# décimo/tretzè TENS-prefix case) stamping straight to its digit is correct.
# Source: standard Italian ordinal-numeral formation (Treccani, "numerali
