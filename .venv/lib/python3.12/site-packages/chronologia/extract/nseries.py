"""Extraction beyond a single span: durations, multi-mention, recurrence.

Three public edges built on the *same* shared pipeline that
:func:`~chronologia.extract.extract_timespan` uses -- the language tokenizer,
number fold and typed vocabulary maps -- so every language is still data only
and the engine core stays language-agnostic:

* :func:`extract_duration` -- a *length* of time ("an hour and a half",
  "2 days 4 hours") as a :class:`datetime.timedelta`, with the leftover text.
* :func:`extract_timespans` -- **all** non-overlapping temporal mentions in a
  sentence, in reading order, each with its token extent (the matcher already
  returns non-overlapping matches; this simply resolves every one instead of
  collapsing to the first).
* :func:`extract_recurrence` -- a recurring phrase ("every friday", "first
  monday of every month") mapped onto the repo's RFC 5545
  :class:`~chronologia.recurrence.Recurrence`, with the leftover text.

Facts stay in the ``locale/<code>/`` vocabulary (weekday names, the ``every``
marker, unit and fraction words); the grammar that assembles those facts is
here, engine-side, so the "N units ago" sign-flip / off-by-a-language bug
class stays unwritable.

    the ordinal "first monday of every month" / "last friday of every month"
    (and "the third thursday of november") -- reading weekday names, unit words
    and the ``every`` marker from the locale.

    **Date-anchored** recurrence composes the *single-span engine* to read the
    date part rather than re-implementing a date grammar:

    * "every 10th of may" / "every may 10" / "every year on may 10" ->
      ``YEARLY;BYMONTH=5;BYMONTHDAY=10`` (the day+month the engine resolves are
      lifted onto ``BYMONTH``/``BYMONTHDAY``);

      ``MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=10``;
    * "every christmas" -> the fixed holiday's real rule
      ``YEARLY;BYMONTH=12;BYMONTHDAY=25``; a **movable** feast ("every easter",
      "every eid al-fitr") -> a :class:`~chronologia.recurrence.HolidayRecurrence`
      (it expands through the holiday engine but cannot serialize to an RRULE).

    A **clock pin** is folded onto the rule: an "at 9" / "at 9:30" / "at noon"
    trailing a rule sets ``BYHOUR`` (and ``BYMINUTE``) -- "daily at 9" ->
    ``FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9``, "every wednesday at 9:30" ->
    ``FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=WE;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=30``.

    A trailing bound is folded onto the rule: an ``until``/``till`` marker plus
    a date sets ``UNTIL`` ("every friday until june"); a ``for`` marker plus a
    fixed-width duration sets ``COUNT`` -- the number of occurrences the
    duration spans at the rule's frequency ("daily for two weeks" -> COUNT=14,
    "every monday for 6 weeks" -> COUNT=6).

    Returns a :class:`RecurrenceResult` -- a ``(recurrence, remainder)`` named
    tuple (unpack it, or read ``.recurrence`` / ``.remainder``) -- or ``None``

    ``consumed`` over the clock(s) (and a leading ``at`` marker, repeated
    before each list item: "a las 9am y a las 5pm").

    A :class:`~chronologia.recurrence.HolidayRecurrence` carries no clock pin,
    so it is left untouched.  Each clock is read by the *same* engine
    ``clock_time`` construction the single-span edge uses (composition, not a
    new grammar); its resolved minute-wide span supplies the hour and minute.

    RFC 5545's ``BYHOUR`` is multi-valued, so a list of full clocks (each with
    its own meridiem) is read item-by-item -- the tokenizer already drops
    commas, so items are separated by nothing, the locale's "and" connector,
    or a repeated leading marker ("a las"), skipped between items the same
    way ``_collect_weekdays`` skips "and" between weekday names.  ``BYMINUTE``
    is a single value shared by the whole rule (there is no per-BYHOUR minute
    in RFC 5545): when every list item names the SAME minute (including all
    on-the-hour), that minute is used; when items disagree ("9:15 and
    17:45"), the rule cannot be honestly expressed as one RRULE, so this
    declines outright (``None``) rather than silently keeping only one
    item's minute -- the same "claim then decline" convention the finders
    and ``_apply_clock_range``/``_apply_range_bound``/``_apply_year_scope``
    already use.

    A rule may ALSO already carry a ``BYHOUR`` pin from
    :func:`_apply_clock_range` (a "between 9 and 5" / postposed clock range,
    whose consumed span never covers a LATER independent "and also at 7"
    clause).  A clock range's ``BYHOUR`` is a deliberately partial reading --
    the *start* of an interval RFC 5545 has no window-end part for -- so
    folding a further trailing clock list onto it here would either be
    misread as one more list item (silently dropping the range's own
    meaning: "9,7" reads as three unrelated pins, not "9-5 plus 7") or
    silently overwritten outright.  Neither is honest, so a trailing clock
    match found while ``rec`` already carries a ``BYHOUR`` declines the
    whole extraction instead -- refusal over a silently wrong rule, the same
    convention the two decline sites above already follow.

    """Fold a stranded "from A to B" / "between A and B" range clause onto
    ``rec``, extending ``consumed`` over the words it reads.

    Reuses the *existing* range connectors (``from``/``between``/``to``/
    ``and``) rather than a new grammar -- it is the same lead/mid vocabulary
    :func:`~chronologia.extract.nseries._merge_ranges` and
    :func:`~chronologia.extract.timespan._extract_range` read for a single-
    span "from A to B".  Two readings, tried in this order:

    * **weekday range** -- both endpoints are bare weekday names ("from
      monday to friday", "from friday to monday"): folds into ``BYDAY``,
      inclusive and wrap-around (friday..monday = FR,SA,SU,MO).  This is the
      idiomatic reading of a weekday-bounded recurrence -- "every day from
      monday to friday" means Mon-Fri, not an unbounded daily rule with the
      clause silently dropped.
    * **date range** -- anything else ("weekly from june to august"): the
      clause is a calendar bound.  Only the *right* endpoint sets a field --
      ``UNTIL`` -- grounded exactly the way a plain "until <date>" bound
      grounds it (:func:`_apply_bounds`'s ``_ground_until``: the resolved
      span's ``start``, so "to august" and "until august" land on the same
      UNTIL).  The left/"from" endpoint names no field ``Recurrence`` has (no
      DTSTART) -- same as the still-unimplemented "starting <date>" today --
      so it is consumed as part of the one clause without contributing a
      value, rather than left stranded in the remainder.

    Declines outright -- rather than guessing -- when ``rec`` already carries
    an ``UNTIL`` (an explicit "until"/"for" bound already claimed the tail)
    or is a :class:`~chronologia.recurrence.HolidayRecurrence` (no RRULE
    fields to fold onto).  A pre-existing ``COUNT`` is cleared when the range
    grounds an ``UNTIL`` -- COUNT and UNTIL are mutually exclusive in RFC
    5545, and UNTIL (the explicit bound) wins, mirroring the same policy in
    :func:`_apply_bounds`.

    R94: a sentence may carry MORE than one stranded range clause -- a
    weekday range AND a date range on top of an already-consumed clock range
    ("every weekday from friday to monday from 9 to 5 from june to august").
    A single first-match-and-stop pass claimed only one clause and left the
    other stranded in the remainder (or, worse, mis-happens to read a bogus
    numeric clause as the date).  This function therefore LOOPS: each
    iteration re-scans for the rightmost still-unclaimed clause (so a genuine
    date-range candidate is preferred over an earlier one, per the ordering
    note below) and claims it -- weekday range -> BYDAY intersection, date
    range -> UNTIL -- then repeats until a full scan claims nothing more. A
    bare-number range ("from 1 to 2") is never accepted as a date-range
    grounding here: unlike "to august"/"to monday", digits alone carry no
    calendar semantics, and accepting them let a leftover numeric range (a
    stray clock-shaped clause :func:`_apply_clock_range` did not claim)
    ground a same-day UNTIL and silently swallow a *real* trailing date
    clause that never got a turn.  Such a clause is left unclaimed here, for
    :func:`_apply_clock` to read afterwards (or to remain stranded in the
    remainder).

    a bare "2028") onto ``rec`` as ``UNTIL``, extending ``consumed`` over the
    words it reads, instead of stranding it in the remainder.

    The scope is read by the *same* single-span engine :func:`_apply_bounds`
    already reuses for "until <date>" -- offering the whole unconsumed TAIL of
    the token stream to :func:`extract_timespan` and accepting the hit only
    when it consumes the tail in full (empty remainder) AND the resolved span
    is exactly one calendar year (Jan 1 .. next Jan 1) -- so a genuine
    non-year trailing date ("every friday next month") or a non-temporal
    trailing word ("every monday please") is left untouched here.

    A named year is a CONTAINMENT scope, not an "until" marker, so the bound
    set is the span's own ``end`` (the first instant *after* the scoped
    year) -- "next year" (2027) grounds the identical ``UNTIL`` value
    "until 2028" already grounds via its own ``.start`` (see
    :func:`_apply_bounds`'s ``_ground_until``), so the two conventions agree
    on one instant rather than silently disagreeing by a year.

    ``Recurrence`` has no ``DTSTART`` field -- ``occurrences()`` takes the
    start as a caller-supplied argument, never a stored one -- so only the
    scope's UPPER edge can be expressed here; the lower edge is left to
    whatever ``dtstart`` the caller passes to ``occurrences()``, the same
    documented limitation :func:`_apply_range_bound` already carries for an
    unimplemented "starting <date>" bound.  This is stated in the module docs
    rather than silently assumed.

    A pre-existing ``UNTIL``/``COUNT`` (an explicit "until"/"for" bound
    already claimed the tail, or a range clause already grounded one) is left
    untouched -- UNTIL/COUNT are mutually exclusive in RFC 5545 and the
    explicit bound already present wins, same policy as
    :func:`_apply_bounds` and :func:`_apply_range_bound`.

    :class:`~chronologia.recurrence.HolidayRecurrence` and
    :class:`~chronologia.recurrence.JurisdictionHolidays` carry **no** bound
    field at all -- their ``occurrences()`` takes ``until``/``count`` only as
    CALL arguments, nothing on the object itself to set -- so a year scope on
    either of them cannot be attached to the returned value without silently
    dropping it or inventing a field that does not exist.  Rather than either,
    this REFUSES the whole extraction (returns ``(None, consumed)``, exactly
    like the ambiguous-UNTIL and empty-intersection declines in
    :func:`_apply_range_bound`) when a year scope is found trailing one of
    these -- the honest "I can't express this bound" rather than a value that
    quietly ignores half of what was asked.

    """``<habitual preposition> <weekday>`` -> ``WEEKLY;BYDAY=<weekday>``.

    Some languages mark a habitual weekday with a **preposition** rather than
    a quantifier: European Portuguese "à segunda-feira" / "às segundas-feiras"
    (on Mondays) is the ordinary way to say "every monday", in both the
    singular and the plural.  Source: Ciberdúvidas da Língua Portuguesa,
    «À(s) segunda(s)-feira(s)», Eunice Marta, 1 June 2012 --
    https://ciberduvidas.iscte-iul.pt/consultorio/perguntas/as-segundas-feiras/31385
    -- which answers that both numbers convey "all Mondays" and that it is the
    **preposition** that carries the habitual sense: a bare article does not.

    Three things follow from that, and each is load-bearing here:

    * The marker is its own ``recur_habitual`` vocabulary, holding only the
      ``a + article`` contractions (pt à/às/ao/aos).  It deliberately does
      **not** hold the ``em + article`` ones (na/no/nas/nos): "na
      segunda-feira" is *on Monday*, one particular date, and that a-vs-em
      contrast is exactly the distinction the source draws.  Keeping them in
      separate vocabularies makes the wrong reading unwritable rather than
      merely unlikely.
    * The same contraction is also the clock marker ("às 9" = at nine), so the
      rule fires only when a **weekday** follows.  A number after it is a
      clock time and is left for the clock pin to read, which is what lets one
      sentence carry both uses.
    * A weekday plural is recognised **only** in this position (the surface
      plus its ``-s`` plural, derived, not listed).  Bare plural weekday
      surfaces cannot go into the global weekday vocabulary -- pt "domingos"
      is also a common surname, and a bare "sextas" makes unrelated
      ordinal-count readings match -- but under an explicit habitual
      preposition there is no such ambiguity.

    The **same** bare-plural-article habitual reading exists in Spanish
    ("los lunes", "the Mondays") and French ("les lundis"): the plural
    definite article alone marks habitual recurrence exactly as pt à/às
    does, while the SINGULAR article ("el lunes", "le lundi") names one
    upcoming date and never reaches here -- ``recur_habitual`` for es/fr
    holds only the plural surfaces (los/las, les), so a singular article is
    simply absent from the vocabulary rather than excluded by a runtime
    check. A list ("los lunes y miércoles", "les lundis et les mercredis")
    is read the same way any other weekday enumeration is -- fr restates
    the article per item, so the collector also swallows a repeated
    habitual marker between list items (see :func:`_collect_weekdays`).

    Runs **last** of the finders: a phrase that already reads as a fuller rule
    ("uma vez por semana à segunda") is claimed by that rule first, so this
    only ever fires on the bare habitual phrase.

# Recurrence finders, first match wins.  The order below is load-bearing, and
# it is NOT the order the functions are defined in above, so tidying the
# file into definition order would silently change what these phrases mean.
# Two constraints hold, measured by reordering this tuple against the whole
# recurrence corpus (every adjacent swap passes; the two moves named here do
# not) -- and enforced by ``test/test_recurrence_finder_order.py``:
#
# * ``_recur_every`` must run AFTER the specific finders.  It is a greedy
#   catch-all: an ``every`` marker plus almost any following count or unit
#   satisfies it, so run first it claims the determiner out of a *longer*
#   specific frame and strands the rest in the remainder -- "every 10th of may"
#   (a yearly date, not a monthly one), "first monday of every month",
#   "jeden 25. dezember", "el 10 de cada mes", "le 10 de chaque mois",
#   "no dia 15 de cada mês".
# * ``_recur_habitual_weekday`` must run LAST.  A habitual phrase carries a
#   frequency *count* ("uma vez por semana à segunda" -- once a week, on
#   monday) whose weekday tail belongs to the more specific reading; run first
#   it wins the weekday alone and drops the count.
#
# The remaining finders are mutually commutable -- their frames do not
# overlap -- so there is no precedence ranking to state here, only those two
# edges.  A table naming every pair would invent structure that is not there.
# ``_recur_repeated_numeral`` (pt/es/fr "de N em/en N <unit>") is one of
# them: its 5-token from/number/in/number/unit shape never satisfies any of
# the other finders' frames, so it is placed anywhere ahead of the
# ``_recur_every``/``_recur_habitual_weekday`` catch-alls.
