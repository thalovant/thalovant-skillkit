"""The single spelled-number fold engine shared by every language family.

Every family's fold does the *same* thing: scan a maximal run of
number-word tokens, read its value with the language's
``extract_number_<lang>`` back-end, and synthesise one digit
:class:`~chronologia.extract.model.Token` that preserves the run's character
extent (``char_start`` of the first token, ``char_end`` of the last).  The
only genuine variation is *data* -- which tokens count as number-words, which
back-end reads the value, and a few real per-family quirks:

* an internal connector inside a run (English "one hundred **and** five",
  Arabic "خمسة **و**عشرون", the Romance ``JOIN_WORD``);
* whether that connector survives into the text handed to the back-end
  (English strips "and"; the Romance/Semitic back-ends read theirs);
* a single-token surface the back-end rejects but a curated map resolves
  (Romance feminine ordinals, the Finnish/Estonian genitive and Greek/Basque
  hour forms);
* a token-stream pre-pass a family runs first (the Germanic word-map and
  ordinal-suffix merge, the Romance a.c./d.c. glue, the Basque case-suffix
  merge, the French elision split ...).

Those are the fields of :class:`NumberGrammar`; :func:`make_fold` turns a
grammar into the ``tuple[Token] -> tuple[Token]`` fold.  This module owns the
*only* copy of the run-scan algorithm and the *only* ``_reindex``.
