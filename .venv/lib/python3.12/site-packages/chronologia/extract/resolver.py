"""Match + anchor + Conventions -> Resolution.  All date math lives here.

Every construction's semantics are computed once, engine-side, shared by
every language.  Notably the *sign* of a ``relative_offset`` is read from
the marker's declared direction (``spec.directions``); a language cannot
get the ago/hence direction wrong because it never writes the sign.

Resolution conventions (chosen once, documented, asserted in tests):

* pure-calendar constructions (``named_day``, ``weekday_ref``,
  ``calendar_date``, ``iso_date``) return midnight of the resolved date;
* ``relative_offset`` shifts the full anchor datetime, preserving its
  time-of-day.

An impossible or unrepresentable date never raises: :meth:`resolve`
returns ``None`` (the matcher offered a span the calendar rejects, so the
construction simply did not fire).

The adopted-extension constructions land their resolvers here:
``clock_time`` (with date composition), ``subdivision_time`` (alternative
day subdivisions), ``scoped_ordinal``, ``season_ref``, ``cycle_ref``
(named day cycles), ``regnal_date`` and ``roman_date``.  ``era_date``
remains declared-but-unimplemented (era phrasing resolves through
``reckoned_date`` / the eras layer) and raises ``NotImplementedError``.

    hint on it, rather than a competing reading -- "evening at 9" is 21:00,
    not a dropped "evening" plus a wrong-by-luck 09:00.

    The clock stays the pinpoint minute; the day-part just supplies the
    AM/PM side of a bare 12-hour reading (a PM-side day-part -- see
    :func:`_daypart_pm_side` -- shifts a spoken 1..11 by +12; an AM-side one
    like ``morning`` leaves it alone).  Over an already-PINNED hour -- an
    explicit am/pm marker on the clock itself, a 24-hour hour ``>= 13``, or
    the literal midnight ``0`` -- the day-part must instead *agree* with
    which side of noon that hour falls on (midnight only agrees with a
    midnight-crossing "night"-shaped band); a genuine clash ("morning at
    9pm") declines rather than silently pick a winner, the same refusal
    convention a contradictory bare-hour-plus-meridiem clock already uses
    (R57).

    ``force_today`` is set for an EXPLICIT-today day-part ("this evening",
    "tonight", "vanavond") -- one that names today's band regardless of the
    wall clock.  The clock's own resolution already ran its "roll to
    tomorrow if already past" rule on the UNSHIFTED hour ("8" < the 10:00
    anchor), which fires wrongly for a day-part that has not been shifted
    into its PM band yet ("tonight at 8" == 20:00, not tomorrow).  Pinning
    the date back to the day-part's own resolved day undoes that premature
    roll; a bare, non-explicit day-part ("evening at 3") keeps the clock's
    roll untouched, per the documented R117 convention.

    Returns ``None`` on contradiction.

        continental form all reach this one resolver, and which of them a
        language writes is settled in the tokenizer.

        The two leading components map to day/month by the locale's ``dmy``
        convention: dmy=true reads day-first ("15/06/2024" = 15 June),

        below).  The year component is 4-digit as written, 2-digit through the
        POSIX ``%y`` pivot.

        Ambiguity guard: when the component the locale flag would read as the
        *month* exceeds 12 while the other is a valid month (<= 12), the two
        are swapped -- "13/12/2024" is unambiguously 13 December even in a

        both components are <= 12 ("01/02/03") the locale flag decides, no
        swap.  Any component that still names no real calendar date (month > 12,
        day 0, day-in-month impossible like 31/02) resolves to None rather than

        Unlike the ordinal ``scoped_bc`` decade ("the 2nd decade bc", counting
        1st/2nd/... decade back from AD 1), this names a decade by its base
        year the way an AD decade does ("the 1990s"): the BC-labelled years
        ``N .. N+9`` -- the "three-hundreds BC" are 309..300 BC.

        Convention (documented, tiled with ``scoped_bc``): both edges are
        derived through the same ``before_christ`` era registry ``scoped_bc``
        uses for its century boundaries, so the two families agree on where a
        BC year sits.  The older edge (span start) is the ``(N+9)``-th BC year;
        the younger edge (span end, exclusive) is the ``(N-1)``-th BC year --
        the first year already in the next, more-recent decade -- so
        consecutive decades tile with no gap.  In astronomical numbering
        (``X`` BC == year ``1 - X``): "the 300s bc" -> ``[-308, -298)``, "the
        290s bc" -> ``[-298, -288)``.  ``N`` must be a positive whole ten;
        anything else does not name a decade and the construction does not
        fire.

        A season-qualified (or month-named) equinox/solstice resolves to the

        The whole-day span mirrors a single-day holiday; the minute-level
        instant precision is documented in ``chronologia.equinoxes``.

        The qualifier names which of the four cardinal events is meant.  A
        season word ("summer") is read hemisphere-aware, exactly as
        ``season_ref`` is: the event that OPENS that astronomical season (north
        summer -> June solstice, south summer -> December solstice).  The formal
        names "vernal"/"autumnal" (SOLARQUAL) map to spring/autumn; a month name
        ("June solstice", "March equinox") names its cardinal event directly.
        A pairing whose event word contradicts its qualifier ("summer equinox")
        does not resolve.

        * an explicit ``YEAR`` slot -> that year;

          "the summer solstice" is next year's.

        A BARE "the solstice"/"the equinox" with no qualifier does not match
        this construction at all (no order lacks the qualifier), so it stays
        unresolved -- the event is ambiguous between the two solstices/equinoxes.
