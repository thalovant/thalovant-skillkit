"""Spelled-number folding for Filipino -- two whole numeral systems at once.

Filipino counts with two complete, living numeral vocabularies: the native
Austronesian set (``isa``, ``dalawa``, ``tatlo``, ...) and a Spanish-derived
set (``uno``, ``dos``, ``tres``, ...).  They are not registers of each other
and they are not in free variation; they are split by GRAMMATICAL SLOT, and a
single date or clock reading routinely draws on both.  Nothing else in the
tree needs two etymologically separate tables, so both live here side by side
with their own composition rules, which genuinely differ:

* the native set joins a tens word to its unit with the enclitic ``'t``
  ("dalawampu't dalawa" == 22) and multiplies with ``libo`` / ``daan``
  ("dalawang libo" == 2000);
* the Spanish set joins by juxtaposition below thirty ("beynte uno" == 21)
  and with ``y`` above it ("kuwarenta y singko" == 45, "trenta y otso" == 38).

No surface belongs to both tables, so a run is read by whichever table its
first word is in and the two never have to be told apart by context.

The clock is where the split bites.  The Spanish-lexified construction states
the hour as a bare cardinal after ``alas``/``ala`` and appends Spanish
minutes ADDITIVELY, with no direction word at all ("alas diyes trenta y
singko ng gabi" == 22:35).  The native construction states the hour as an
``ika-`` ORDINAL and counts native minutes toward it in one of two
directions -- ``makalipas`` ("after") for the first half of the hour,
``bago`` ("before") for the second ("limang minuto makalipas ang ika-anim ng
umaga" == 06:05; "labinlimang minuto bago ang ika-apat ng hapon" == 15:45).
The same ``ika-`` ordinal spells the day of a date ("ika-24 ng Agosto"),
which is why the ordinal pass folds to a bare integer and lets the
surrounding construction decide whether it read an hour or a day.

Because the Spanish-lexified minutes carry no direction word, the shared
clock grammar has nowhere to bind them -- a MINUTE slot only ever reaches the
resolver alongside a CLOCKDIR, which this construction does not have.  The
minute run is fused into the hour here instead, into one ``HH:MM`` clock
literal the grammar reads verbatim, mirroring the Vietnamese additive-minute
fold (:mod:`chronologia.extract.numfold_vietnamese`) for the same reason: the
alternative is a minute count silently dropped from the answer.

Sources: en.wiktionary.org, Category:Tagalog cardinal numbers (each cardinal
and ordinal surface below is an entry there, checked individually); the
en.wiktionary.org ``ika-`` entry, which glosses the prefix both as the
ordinal former and as "used to express o'clock"; and en.wikipedia.org, "Date
and time notation in the Philippines", for the worked clock and date examples
(including "alas singko trenta y otso ng hapon" == 17:38 and "alas diyes
trenta y singko ng gabi" == 22:35) and for the ``makalipas``/``bago`` split.

Deliberately absent, each because no per-word attestation was found rather
than because the value was in doubt: ``sesenta`` (60) and ``nobenta`` (90),
whose Wiktionary entries carry only a money noun and no numeral sense; the
variant spellings ``kwatro``, ``sais``, ``nwebe``, ``dyes``, ``bente`` and
``kwarenta``, which have no Tagalog entry under those spellings while
``kuwatro``, ``seis``, ``nuwebe``, ``diyes``, ``beynte`` and ``kuwarenta``
do; the ordinals ``ikadalawa`` and ``ikatatlo``, the attested second and
third being the suppletive ``ikalawa`` and ``ikatlo``; and ``una``, glossed
as the adjective "first" rather than as a numeral, and far too common a word
to fold to 1 on that basis.
