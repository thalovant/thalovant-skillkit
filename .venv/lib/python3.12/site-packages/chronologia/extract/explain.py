"""``explain(text, spec, anchor)`` -- the pipeline's debug window.

Replays tokenizer -> normaliser -> matcher -> resolver and reports, in
one immutable trace: the tokens seen, every candidate construction, which
matches were selected (with their resolved value), and *why* each losing
candidate lost -- longer rival span or higher-precedence rival on an
overlapping span.  This is the antidote to "engine regexes become
undebuggable": constructions are named slots, and the trace shows the
contest.
