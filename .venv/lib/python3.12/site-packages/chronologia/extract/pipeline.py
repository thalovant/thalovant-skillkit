"""The shared pre-match token pipeline: text -> the exact tokens the matcher sees.

Both the public :func:`~chronologia.extract.extract_timespan` path and the
:func:`~chronologia.extract.explain` debug window run this identical sequence
so a trace never misrepresents a real parse:

1. tokenize (language tokenizer modes);
2. normalise (temporal-lemma / suffix-strip morphology);
3. the language ``hook`` (English: the spelled-number fold ``numfold``), so a
   written-out number ("the fifth of june") binds the same slot a digit would;
4. multiword-vocab merge -- period surfaces the tokenizer split ("bronze age")
   folded back into one token so a single slot can bind them.

Factored here (rather than duplicated in the engine facade and the explain
window) precisely because a divergence between the two is the bug this module
exists to prevent.
