"""Anchored arithmetic: an offset applied to a *resolved reference*.

Two families of construction live here, both built by **composition** on
top of the ordinary resolved matches -- no reference date is re-parsed, the
already-resolved :class:`~chronologia.extract.model.Resolution` object is
transformed (objects-in, objects-out):

* **offset-from-reference** ("two weeks after easter", "3 days before
  christmas", "the monday after christmas", "the friday before easter"):
  a signed unit offset -- or a strict weekday roll -- applied to any
  date-resolving submatch (holiday, calendar date, weekday ref, ...).  The
  reference is *whatever the engine already resolved* immediately after the
  directional marker; this pass finds that marker + a stranded offset
  pre-amble and rewrites the reference's span.

* **ordinal counting from the anchor** ("3 fridays from now", "2 mondays
  ago", "the weekend after next"): the N-th occurrence of a weekday
  strictly after/before *now*, or the weekend one past the next.  These do
  not need a reference match -- they synthesise a resolution straight from
  the token stream, so they fire even when the bare matcher found nothing.

Every surface is read from the language's own vocabulary
(``after``/``before``/``from``/``of`` connectors, ``present`` marker,
``weekdays``, ``units``, ``weekend_words``, ``plural`` suffix): the logic is
generic, the facts are data.

    "in a year and a day", "1 year, 2 months and 3 days") into ONE point,
    instead of the bare :func:`~chronologia.extract.resolver._resolve_relative_offset`
    reading only its own leading ``NUM UNIT`` and stranding every further
    ``[and|,] NUM UNIT`` chunk in the remainder.

    Every chunk shares the leading offset's sign (direction marker):
    "in 3 months and 2 days" both add, "3 months and 2 days ago" both
    subtract -- a compound never mixes directions, so one marker covers the
    whole phrase.

    Composition happens in TWO passes over the summed chunks, not one
    sequential walk, so the result never depends on the TEXTUAL order the
    units were said in ("in 3 months and 2 days" and the reversed "in 2 days
    and 3 months" land on the identical instant): every calendar-grain
    chunk (month/year/decade/century/millennium) is summed to a single
    month-count and applied first, in :class:`AstroDate`'s own proleptic
    space (never stdlib ``datetime``, whose year bounds a BC/deep-time
    composition would overrun); every fixed-width chunk (second .. fortnight)
    is summed to a single ``timedelta`` and applied second. Calendar-then-
    fixed is the natural reading order in any case ("3 months and 2 days"
    means the 15th, 3 months on, plus 2 more days) and, applied AFTER the
    month roll, never re-triggers month-end clamping.

    The composed span is a POINT of the FINEST unit named anywhere in the
    compound ("in 3 months and 2 days" -> a DAY-wide span, matching what a
    bare "in 2 days" already returns) -- the same granularity convention the
    single-unit reading already follows, just extended to the widest (finest)
    grain present.

    A postposed marker ("3 months and 2 days **ago**") closes the phrase
    instead of opening it, so any LEADING ``NUM UNIT [and|,]`` chunk sits
    BEFORE the matched span rather than after it -- folded here by scanning
    :func:`_scan_leading_chunks` backward from the match whenever the marker
    is the match's own last token.  Both scans run (a compound could, in
    principle, carry chunks on both sides); the direction marker's sign
    covers every folded chunk regardless of which side it came from, so
    "3 months and 2 days ago" and "2 days and 3 months ago" land on the
    identical instant, same as the forward-only compounds already do.

    A second, sibling family folds into a rolling ``rel_span`` ("the next 2
    weeks and 3 days", "the last 2 weeks and 3 days"): unlike
    ``relative_offset``'s single point, ``rel_span`` already resolves to a
    ``[today, far)`` / ``[far, today)`` span (:meth:`_resolve_rel_span`), so
    a trailing chunk EXTENDS the rolling ``far`` end further in the same
    direction as the ``next``/``last`` marker, rather than composing a new
    point.

    A lone, un-extended match (no chunk found on either side) is returned
    untouched; only constructions actually carrying a composable chunk are
    rewritten.
