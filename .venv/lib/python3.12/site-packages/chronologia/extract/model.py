"""Frozen value types shared by every stage of the declarative engine.

These mirror the object model in
``docs/design/declarative-datetime-engine.md``.  Every value type is a
frozen dataclass so each pipeline stage consumes and produces immutable,
hashable, comparable values and can be unit-tested in isolation.

Deviations from the design doc (recorded here as the doc requires):

* ``LangSpec.vocab: Mapping[str, frozenset[str]]`` in the doc is split
  into several **typed, value-bearing** maps (``months`` surface->int,
  ``units`` surface->kind, ``named_days`` surface->offset, ``directions``
  surface->sign, ...).  A bare ``frozenset`` of surface forms cannot carry
  the month number, day offset or direction sign a slot needs; those
  values are facts encoded via the loader's filename convention
  (``month_6.voc``, ``named_day_+1.voc``, ``marker_past.voc``), so no
  behaviour leaks into the JSON.  See ``loader.py``.
* ``Resolution.value`` is a :class:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan`
  (endpoints are always ``AstroDate``); the ``DateTimeResolution`` is derived
  from the span's width, not stored, per the doc's reckoning model.
* ``SlotOrder`` is expanded into a tuple of parsed ``SlotElement`` (the
  doc names it as an opaque type); optionality (``DAY?``) and the
  slot/connector distinction are pre-parsed so the matcher stays a plain
  walk.
