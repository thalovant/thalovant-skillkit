"""Spelled-number folding pre-pass for Vietnamese.

The tokenizer only recognises *digit* runs as numbers; Vietnamese speech
spells them, so a maximal run of spelled number-words is folded into a single
digit :class:`~chronologia.extract.model.Token` and a ``NUM``/``DAY``/``HOUR``
slot then binds the same whether the writer typed ``3`` or the word.

Vietnamese is isolating -- nothing declines, nothing agrees -- so there is no
case or gender machinery here at all.  What there is instead is a set of
POSITIONAL substitutions: the same digit is spoken with a different word
depending on where it sits in the numeral, and reading the citation form in
those positions gives a wrong value rather than no value.

* ``mười`` (10) is the free form and opens the teens (``mười lăm`` 15), but a
  tens digit above twenty takes the reduced ``mươi``: ``hai mươi`` 20,
  ``năm mươi`` 50.
* a final 5 above ten is ``lăm`` (northern also ``nhăm``), never ``năm``:
  ``mười lăm`` 15, ``hai mươi lăm`` 25.  The substitution exists because
  ``năm`` is also the word for "year", and it is why this fold never reads a
  bare ``năm`` as five (see :data:`PLAIN`).
* a final 1 after ``mươi`` is ``mốt``: ``hai mươi mốt`` 21.
* a final 4 after ``mười``/``mươi`` is commonly ``tư``: ``mười tư`` 14,
  ``hai mươi tư`` 24.
* a hundreds group with an empty tens digit is filled by ``linh`` (northern)
  or ``lẻ`` (southern/central): ``một trăm linh một`` 101.  A final 5 in that
  position keeps ``năm`` -- the ``lăm`` rule does not reach it -- so ``năm``
  reads as five there and nowhere else outside a multiplier position.
* the thousand is ``nghìn`` in the north and ``ngàn`` in the south; both are
  read, because the choice is regional rather than stylistic.

Two positions are deliberately left unfolded.  A ONE-WORD numeral directly
after ``thứ`` or ``tháng`` is a NAME component, not a count -- ``thứ hai`` is
Monday and ``tháng tư`` is April -- and the locale lists those surfaces whole,
in both their spelled and their CLDR digit spelling, so folding the numeral
there would only destroy the surface the vocabulary matches.  A numeral that
runs longer than one word after those heads is folded, because no weekday name
runs that long and ``thứ`` is also the ordinal marker (``thứ tám`` eighth):
``thứ hai mươi`` is the twentieth, not Monday with ``mươi`` left over.  The
month names spell their long numerals in digits too (``tháng mười hai`` ==
``tháng 12``), so the fold leaves them matching.  And ``năm`` standing
alone is read as the noun "year", never as five: the two are the same word
with the same tone, Vietnamese itself resorts to ``lăm`` to keep them apart in
compounds, and no cue distinguishes them in "năm năm" or "năm giờ".  Refusing
is the only reading that cannot be silently wrong; the digit spelling ``5``
carries the count instead.

The spoken clock hangs its minutes off the hour with ``phút``: ``bốn giờ mười
phút`` is 04:10.  That shape is fused here into one clock literal, because a
minute count only ever reaches the resolver alongside a direction word, and
the additive form has none -- read as a bare hour it would silently drop the
minutes.  The subtractive ``kém`` form (``ba giờ kém mười lăm`` == 02:45) is
NOT fused: it carries its direction word and the clock grammar reads it.
