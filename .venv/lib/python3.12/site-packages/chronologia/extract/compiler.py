"""LangSpec -> compiled matcher table, cached per language.

Compilation is cheap here (the heavy lifting is the loader's vocab read),
but the contract from the design doc is that a language compiles **once**
and every later parse reuses the cached table.  The cache is keyed by
language code; :meth:`ConstructionCompiler.compile` returns the *same*
object on repeat calls (identity-stable, so callers may cache derived
state safely).

Construction precedence (era > scoped > calendar, per the doc) is baked
into the compiled ordering so the matcher's tie-break is a plain lookup.
