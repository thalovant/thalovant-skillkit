"""Tokens -> matches, with precedence and longest-span resolution.

Each construction order is matched by a plain backtracking walk over its
:class:`SlotElement` sequence (optional slots try both present and
skipped; the longest consumption wins).  Slot binding is a single lookup
into the language's typed vocab maps -- there are no per-language regexes
to debug, only named slots.

Overlap resolution follows the doc: among competing matches the longest
span wins, ties broken by precedence (era > scoped > calendar > ...).
Selected matches never overlap.
