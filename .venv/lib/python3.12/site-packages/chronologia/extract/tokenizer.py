"""Text -> tuple[Token] with per-language mode flags.

Two invented-word-friendly modes matter for the synthetic locale and the
first migration wave:

* ``split_contractions`` -- an apostrophe acts as a token separator
  (``d'aujourd'hui`` -> ``d aujourd hui``) rather than an in-word letter.
* ``ordinal_dot`` -- a digit run followed by a dot (``5.``) is one numeric
  token, the trailing dot stripped (German-style ordinals).

Numbers are detected as digit runs (optionally decimal); spelled-number
normalisation is a separate binding applied by the normaliser, so the
tokenizer stays language-neutral.  ISO date literals (``2017-06-30``) are
kept as a single token for the ``iso_date`` pre-pass.

# guard makes the literal all-or-nothing, so a digit run that continues past
# the shape falls through to the plain-number rule where it belongs.
# The year-month alternative additionally refuses a following "-<digit>": that
# is the head of a longer dashed run ("2026-07-244"), and reading a month out
# of its first seven characters is the same stranded-tail wrong.
# The dotted alternative is the Hungarian civil form: the Academy's

# dots, "2020.06.15".  It needs no per-locale switch for the same reason the
# dashed and slashed forms do not -- a four-digit lead is year-first
# everywhere -- and it cannot collide with a decimal number or a thousands
# group, because both of those are refused by the two required dots and by the

# ``dotted_date`` tokenizer mode rather than always, because a locale that has
# no dotted convention must keep reading "06.15.2020" as the two numbers it is;
# English in particular writes the dot in neither order.
#
# The dot was excluded here for a long time, on the grounds that it collides
# with the decimal-number and ordinal-dot shapes.  The collision is real but
# the exclusion did not produce the refusal it was meant to: "15.06.2020" fell
# through to the bare-number rule, the year matched alone, and the caller got a
# confident whole-year span with "15.06" stranded in the remainder -- silently
# wrong for the most ordinary way most of Europe writes a date.  Three
# components with two dots is what keeps the shape apart from both colliders: a
# decimal ("2.5") and a thousands group ("1.000", "1.000.000" in German) never
# carry two dots with a 1-2 digit head and a 2-4 digit tail, and an ordinal dot
# ("15. Juni") is followed by a space and a word, never by a digit.  The literal
# is matched ahead of the ordinal-dot and bare-number rules so the whole date
# binds as one token instead of being eaten piecewise.
#
# Both boundary guards are load-bearing, exactly as in _ISO.  "(?!\d)" refuses
# a longer digit run ("15.06.20201"), and "(?!\.\d)" refuses the head of a
# longer dotted run, so "1.2.3.4" and "1.15.06.2020" name no date at all
# instead of yielding a date plus a stranded tail.
# The same national standards that write "15.06.2020" write it in running
# prose with a single space after each dot -- "15. 6. 2020" is the everyday
# German (DIN 5008), Czech/Slovak (CSN/STN 01 6910), Finnish, Russian etc.
# form.  Without the optional space the three dotted-with-space pieces fall
# apart on the whitespace split into "15.", "6." and "2020"; the ordinal-dot
# rule ate the first two, the year matched alone, and the caller got a
# confident whole-year span with "15. 6." stranded -- the very silent wrong the
# space-less literal exists to end.  A single optional space after each interior
# dot keeps the shape one token.  The 2-4 digit year still anchors the pattern,
# so a bare "15. 6." (two ordinals, no year) matches nothing and fabricates no
# date, and the trailing boundary guards are unchanged.
# The leading "(?<!\d\.)" refuses a date whose head is glued to a preceding
# "digit." -- so "1.15.06.2020" stays a malformed run (its "15.06.2020" tail
# does not bind).  It is deliberately NOT extended to a spaced "digit. " form:
# a numbered-list item before a real date -- "1. 15.06.2020", "5. 5.6.2020" --
# is a genuine date the guard must let through, not shred.

# nothing in the token regex, so "1/2 hour" tokenized as the two bare numbers
# "1" and "2" with nothing to say they were EVER joined; the unit-count fold
# then bound the *second* number to the unit ("2 hours") and stranded the
# first as an unexplained remainder ("1") -- a silent misread, not a refusal.
