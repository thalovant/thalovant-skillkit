"""Spelled-number folding pre-pass.

The tokenizer only recognises *digit* runs as numbers; natural speech spells
them ("five days ago", "the twenty fifth", "the third week of june").  This
pass folds a maximal run of number-words into a single digit
:class:`~chronologia.extract.model.Token` so every ``NUM``/``DAY``/``YEAR``/
``ORD`` slot binds the same way whether the writer typed ``5`` or ``five``.

This module holds the English fold plus every locale whose fold does not
share a family engine with another language (``fa``, ``id``, ``kab``,
``ms``), and the primitives multiple family modules import rather than
duplicate: the ``_make_germanic_fold``/``_lazy_germanic_fold`` single-extractor
engine (also used by ``numfold_germanic`` and ``numfold_turkic``).  The
Romance family (an/ast/ca/es/fr/gl/it/mwl/oc/pt/ro) lives in
``numfold_romance``, the Continental/North Germanic family (da/de/fy/nb/nl/nn/
sv) in ``numfold_germanic``, and the Turkic family (az/tr) in
``numfold_turkic``.  The Slavic, Semitic, Baltic, Indo-Aryan and
agglutinative families each have their own sibling module already
(``numfold_slavic``, ``numfold_semitic``, ``numfold_baltic``,
``numfold_indic``, ``numfold_agglutinative``); ``numfold_baltic`` and
``numfold_indic`` own their number tables outright and read no external
number back-end.  Hindi could not use one in any case: its 1..99 numerals are
suppletive, so there is no rule for a generative back-end to apply.

Wired as a language ``hook`` in each locale's ``lang.json`` and applied by
:meth:`DateTimeEngine.tokenize` after normalisation.  Every fold is a pure
``tuple[Token] -> tuple[Token]`` transform, re-indexed so ``Token.index``
stays contiguous.

The English value is read from
:func:`ovos_number_parser.numbers_en.extract_number_en` (``ordinals=True``);
the fold owns only *which* tokens form a run.  Clock fractions ("half",
"quarter") are deliberately **not** number-words here -- they are their own
``FRACTION`` slot vocabulary and must survive intact.

        ``n`` in 10..99 -- "nineteen hundred" (1900), "nineteen hundred and
        five" (1905).  ``n`` below ten is not a century prefix, so "one
        hundred and five" keeps its plain-number reading.

    ``<n> thousand [and] [<m>]``
        "two thousand" (2000), "two thousand and one" (2001), "two thousand
        and twenty four" (2024).  Unambiguous: the digit form ``2001`` already
        reads as a year, so the spelled form must too -- no cue needed.
        ``n`` runs 1..99, so the composed year covers the same
        ``GYEAR_MIN..GYEAR_MAX`` window a digit year does: "twenty thousand"
        reads exactly as ``20000`` does, and a spelled year outside the
        window resolves to nothing just as the digits would.  The magnitude
        is never what tells a year from deep time -- a closing unit word is
        ("ninety nine thousand years ago" stays an offset, refused below).

    ``<c> <y>`` (year pair, **licensing context required**)
        "nineteen ninety-nine" (1999), "twenty twenty-four" (2024).  A bare
        pair is genuinely ambiguous with a plain number, so it only reads as a
        year after a cue word ("in ...", "the year ..." -- taken from the

        first, twenty twenty six"), where the only date slot still open is the

        and ``y`` must itself be 10..99: a bare ones suffix is refused, both
        because "in twenty five days" is a count and because English spells
        that year with "oh" ("nineteen oh five").

    Refusals are deliberate, never a guess: any component outside 0..99, a
    further scale word riding on the construction ("two thousand and one
    hundred thousand"), a run that is not a well-formed 0-99 component
    ("ninety nine ninety nine"), or a unit word closing the phrase ("two
