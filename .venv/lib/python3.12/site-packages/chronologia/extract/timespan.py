"""Single-span date extraction: the ``extract_timespan`` implementation.

The declarative construction engine that turns a date written the way a human
writes it into the *referential width* of the phrase -- a half-open
:class:`~chronologia.astrodate.DateSpan`.  This module holds the single-span
public edges (:func:`extract_timespan`, :func:`extract_candidates`), the range
and open-range composition family, the per-dialect short/long scale policy, the
exclusion / impossible-date vetoes, the :class:`DateSpanResult` return type, and
the :class:`DateTimeEngine` facade with its lazy per-language engine cache.

The package ``chronologia.extract`` re-exports these names, so the public import
site is unchanged.  Keeping the implementation in this leaf module (which imports
only the engine-core modules, never the package ``__init__``) is what lets the
package ``__init__`` be a thin facade and lets :mod:`chronologia.extract.nseries`
import the shared helpers at module scope with no import cycle.

    Ortografia de la lengua espanola 5.2.5.1), "du 5 au 12 juin", "dal 5 al 12
    giugno" -- and English writes it too ("June 5 to 12").  The endpoint left

    reading the core already resolved.

    Fires ONLY on the exact defect signature: the core consumed everything
    from some index ``j`` onward (the endpoint "X" resolved standalone,
    ``span``/``consumed`` already describe it) while a "before"/"after"
    marker LEADS the stream at position 0 and is itself, together with any
    gap words up to ``j``, entirely UNCONSUMED. This is deliberately a
    *post-hoc* check on the core's own resolution rather than an independent
    pre-scan: a pre-scan that tried to resolve "<marker> <rest>" on its own
    would also fire on an unrelated construction that merely happens to
    START with the same surface as the locale's "before" connector (Danish
    "for" is both "before" AND the lead-in article of "for N UNIT siden" =
    "N UNIT ago", which fully consumes -- and legitimately means something
    else entirely -- on its own). Requiring the REST of the core's own
    resolution to already be complete except for the marker rules that out:
    "for tre dage siden" is fully consumed by the ordinary "ago" grammar
    (nothing stranded), so this never touches it; "for jul" ("before
    christmas") leaves "for" stranded beside an otherwise-complete "jul"
    match, which is exactly the shape this closes.

    "before X" mirrors the "until X" open-range binding EXACTLY: ``[now, X's
    end)`` when X's end is in the FUTURE. When it is not (an explicit past
    date, "before easter 2020"), the shape is recognised but contradictory --
    refused, never silently reinterpreted as a bare "X" with "before" dropped.

    "after X" has no natural representation: :class:`DateSpan` is a closed
    ``[start, end)`` pair of :class:`AstroDate`, and unlike "since X" --
    whose open side is anchored to "now" as the END (``[X, now)``, still a
    closed pair) -- "after X" would need an open-ended FUTURE, which the type
    cannot express. Rather than strand the word or fabricate an artificial
    end, a bare "after X" is refused outright.

    Returns ``(new_span, new_consumed)`` on a successful bare "before",
    ``"veto"`` when the shape is recognised but the WHOLE parse must be
    refused, or ``None`` when this is not the shape at all (unchanged core
    result stands).

    minute-wide one).  ``DateSpan.start_datetime`` / ``end_datetime`` yield
    real ``datetime`` (or ``None`` when out of range).

    ``anchor`` is the "now" relative phrases resolve against (default: the
    wall clock).  Only languages with locale data are supported; others
    raise :class:`NotImplementedError`.

    **Time zones.** Resolution is *wall-clock*: the anchor is read as a local
    civil time and the returned :class:`~chronologia.DateSpan` is naive.  A
    tz-aware ``anchor`` has its ``tzinfo`` dropped (its wall-clock fields are
    used as-is), so "tomorrow at 3pm" is 15:00 on the anchor's clock regardless
    of zone, and a relative offset ("in 20 hours") is wall-clock arithmetic that
    does **not** apply DST transitions.  Localize the naive result yourself if
    you need an absolute instant.

    Returns a :class:`DateSpanResult` -- a ``(span, remainder)`` named tuple
    (unpack it, or read ``.span`` / ``.remainder``) -- or ``None`` when nothing
    matched.

    ``jurisdiction`` (an ISO country code such as ``'PT'``) scopes the
    business-day constructions ("in 5 business days", "the next working day"):
    a business day is a non-weekend weekday that is also not a public holiday of
    that jurisdiction.  With ``jurisdiction=None`` the count is *holiday-blind*
    -- weekend-aware but treating every weekday as a business day -- because
    which weekdays are public holidays cannot be known without a jurisdiction.

    A "from A to B" / "between A and B" range yields the span from the start
    of the left sub-parse to the end of the right one (``june 5th to june
    12th`` -> a seven-day span); the endpoints are two independent parses.

    ``scale`` selects the short/long scale that disambiguates a deep-time
    "billion"-cognate ("a billion years ago" is 10^9 short, 10^12 long):
    ``"short"`` or ``"long"`` hard-override, ``None`` (default) takes the

    dialect (``pt-BR`` short, ``pt-PT`` long) while loading the same base
    locale, a bare code its naming country's norm.

    ``text`` must be a ``str``; anything else raises :class:`TypeError`.

    unambiguous way to fold "for 2 hours" onto a whole day.

    The duration TAIL is re-read from the ORIGINAL ``text`` (via a fresh

    rendered ``remainder`` string: :func:`~chronologia.extract.pipeline.
    render_remainder` slices a maximal run of index-consecutive unconsumed
    tokens by ``[run[0].char_start : run[-1].char_end]``, which silently
    truncates whenever the number-fold leaves a narrower-charspan token
    (e.g. "hour") positioned in the stream after a wider one that already
    covers its characters (e.g. "an hour and a half" folding to a
    ``1.5``-valued token spanning the whole phrase, plus a residual
    "hour" token nested inside it) -- exactly the shape "an hour and a
    half" folds to.  Re-deriving the tail from ``text`` sidesteps that
    unrelated pre-existing rendering quirk instead of inheriting it; the
    PREFIX (the leftover before the marker) is unaffected by the quirk --
    it is text ``remainder`` renders correctly -- so it is still read from
    ``remainder``.

    An utterance names one duration bound, so the LAST marker occurrence in
    each string is used (the tail search additionally skips any marker
    that falls inside a construction's own already-consumed characters,
    e.g. a marker surface that happens to double as part of the resolved
    date/clock's own vocabulary). The tail after the marker must START
    with a bare fixed-width duration reading -- if it does not (a spurious
    "for" that names no duration at all), the slice is left untouched, no
    end is fabricated. Any further trailing text the duration reading does
    not itself consume ("... for 2 hours to discuss the budget") is kept,
    appended after the pre-marker prefix, so an embedded sentence loses
    nothing. An explicit-end range ("9am to 11am on monday") never reaches
    this function: it is composed by :func:`_extract_range`, which returns
    before the SINGLE core (and this call) ever runs, so its own
