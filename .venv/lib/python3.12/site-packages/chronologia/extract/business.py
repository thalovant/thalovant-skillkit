"""Business-day counting ("in 5 business days", "the next working day",
"3 working days after christmas").

A **business day** (a.k.a. working day) is a calendar day that is neither a
weekend day nor a public holiday:

* the *weekend* is the locale's own two-day rest period -- the pair of
  weekdays ``(weekend_start, weekend_start+1)`` read from
  :attr:`~chronologia.extract.model.Conventions.weekend_start` (Saturday+Sunday
  in the Western default, Friday+Saturday where a locale declares it), never
  hard-coded here;
* a *public holiday* is looked up through the shared civil-holiday engine
  (:func:`~chronologia.civil_holidays.is_civil_holiday` with
  ``categories=("public",)``), which **requires a jurisdiction**.  Holiday data
  is never re-derived here -- the calendar owns it.

Because the holiday calendar is jurisdiction-scoped, the public edge takes an
optional ``jurisdiction`` (``extract_timespan(..., jurisdiction='PT')``).  With
**no jurisdiction** the count is *holiday-blind*: a business day is simply a
non-weekend weekday.  This is an honest, documented default -- weekday counting
is universal, but which weekdays are public holidays is not knowable without a
jurisdiction.

On the ``ouvrable``/``ouvré`` distinction (and the like in other languages):
French law draws a fine line between *jours ouvrables* (all days except the
weekly rest day and public holidays, historically up to six per week) and
*jours ouvrés* (days actually worked, typically five).  Chronologia does not
model that payroll-grade distinction: **both** surfaces resolve to the same
Monday-to-Friday-minus-public-holidays business day, matching the everyday
"working day" sense a speaker means when they say "in five working days".

Two shapes fire, both by composition on the token stream (objects-in,
objects-out), mirroring :mod:`chronologia.extract.anchored`:

* **count from the anchor** ("in N business days", "N working days", "the next
  working day" == N=1): the N-th business day strictly after the anchor date, a
  day-wide span;
* **count from a resolved reference** ("3 working days after christmas", "two
  business days before new year"): the same count, but taken from a
  date-resolving submatch the engine already produced -- the reference is
  *whatever was resolved* just past the ``after``/``before`` marker.

The surfaces are a per-locale fact (``marker_business.voc``: business/working,
dia útil, día hábil/laborable, Werktag/Arbeitstag, jour ouvrable/ouvré); the
counting logic is generic.
