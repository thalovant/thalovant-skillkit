"""Timelines: a jurisdiction's history of civil label-mappings.

The astronomical timeline (JDN / :class:`~chronologia.astrodate.AstroDate`)
never has discontinuities — it is a pure count of days.  Only *civil*
label-mappings jump: a pope, parliament, tsar or emperor decrees that
"tomorrow" shall be called something the calendar in force would never have
generated.  Calendars stay pure proleptic bijections; a **Timeline** records,
for one jurisdiction, which calendar was in force over each stretch of JDN and
what its one-time reforms did to the labels.

Model
-----
* :class:`TimelineSegment` — an ordered ``(start_jdn, calendar_key)`` stretch,
  optionally carrying a civil ``year_start`` (the ``(month, day)`` on which the
  civil year number turns over) and a constant ``year_offset``.
* :class:`Discontinuity` — a one-time event at a JDN, one of four
  :class:`DiscontinuityKind`:

  - **SKIP** — labels that never existed (Rome: 5–14 October 1582; Britain:
    3–13 September 1752).  The two calendars straddling the seam both place the
    queried label across it, so no JDN ever bore it.
  - **REPEAT** — a day lived twice.  The fall-back form is *one label, two
    JDNs*: :meth:`Timeline.to_jdn` yields the two-candidate tuple.  Alaska
    1867's *weekday* form is the mirror image — *two labels, one JDN*: the last
    Julian day and the first Gregorian day share a solar JDN, so both civil
    labels resolve to it.
  - **INSERT** — a label no calendar in force generates (Sweden, 30 February
    1712), supplied as a timeline-level label override on a single JDN.
  - **RELABEL** — a year-start / numbering change (England, 25 March → 1
    January in 1752, with dual dating "1731/32"), expressed per segment through
    the ``year_start`` machinery that the era layer already uses.

Properties (design, issue #1 "Timelines & discontinuities"): duration math is
unaffected because it always happens in JDN space; a non-existent label returns
a typed :class:`NeverExisted` ("never existed + why", carrying the
discontinuity) rather than raising; conversions default to the **proleptic**
timeline (:func:`proleptic`, zero discontinuities = zero behaviour change).
The boundary rule: predictable from the calendar's own law → it belongs to the
calendar; it took a pope / parliament / tsar / emperor → it belongs to a
timeline.  Timezone shifts (Samoa 2011) are *not* discontinuities.

Sources:

* Wikipedia, "Adoption of the Gregorian
  calendar": "the day after Thursday, 4 October 1582 was dated as Friday, 15
  October 1582"; the Catholic states of the Holy Roman Empire, the Italian
  principalities, Poland–Lithuania, and Spain–Portugal were first to adopt.
* Wikipedia, "Old Style and New Style dates": England's civil year began on
  25 March (Lady Day) until 1751; dual dating "1731/32" for dates between
  1 January and 24 March under the two reckonings.
* Wikipedia, "Calendar (New Style) Act 1750": 1 January 1752 fixed as
  new-year's day (1751 ran 25 March – 31 December), and Wednesday 2 September
  1752 followed by Thursday 14 September 1752 (eleven days omitted).
* Wikipedia, "Swedish calendar": in use 1 March 1700 – 30 February 1712, "one
  day ahead of the Julian calendar and ten days behind the Gregorian"; Sweden
  reverted to the Julian calendar in 1712 (via the double leap day
  30 February 1712) and adopted the Gregorian in 1753.
* Wikipedia, "Japanese calendar": Gregorian introduced in 1873; the Tenpō
  lunisolar calendar was the reference calendar 1844–1872, before the switch
  at Meiji 6 = 1 January 1873.

# -- sweden_1700_1712: the gradual mess, modelled to what the source pins ---
# Wikipedia, "Swedish calendar": the Swedish calendar was in use 1 March 1700
# – 30 February 1712, "one day ahead of the Julian calendar and ten days behind
# the Gregorian"; Sweden reverted to the Julian calendar in 1712 via the double
# leap day 30 February 1712, and adopted the Gregorian in 1753.
#
# SIMPLIFICATION (documented): the branch registry has no Swedish calendar
# (Julian-minus-one-day, 1700–1712), so the 1700–1712 one-day divergence is NOT
# modelled as its own segment.  The timeline models the two label-affecting
# events the source pins exactly: the INSERT of 30 February 1712 (= the day the
# Julian calendar calls 29 February 1712 = Gregorian 11 March 1712, "ten days
# behind the Gregorian"), and the 1753 Gregorian adoption.  Consequences:
#   * the underlying calendar is Julian throughout 1700–1753 (what Sweden used
#     after the 1712 reversion; a close proxy before 1700);
#   * the actual day at the INSERT JDN carries only the "30 February 1712"
#     label — the Julian "29 February 1712" label it would otherwise bear is
#     shadowed by the override (Sweden really had both that year; the extra
#     day is what is preserved here as the notable civil label).

# calendar day*, which is a genuine label discontinuity — a day-number that no
# JDN ever bore, or a weekday lived twice.  The underlying calendar stays
# Gregorian throughout each of these, so the seam is expressed with a
# ``jdn_shift`` on the post-seam segment (see :class:`TimelineSegment`) rather

# -- alaska_1867: the double event — REPEAT + Julian->Gregorian switch ------
# The only place in this registry where two discontinuity kinds meet at one
# seam.  Wikipedia, "International Date Line": the transfer of Russian America
# took place on the solar afternoon Europe reckoned as Saturday 19 October 1867
# (Gregorian).  Sitka had been keeping the Julian calendar, so its last day
# under Russian rule was **Friday, 6 October 1867 (Julian)**; and because Alaska
# simultaneously crossed to the *eastern* side of the International Date Line,
# the transfer day was relabelled one weekday back — **Friday, 18 October 1867
# (Gregorian)**, "now known as Alaska Day".  So a Friday was directly followed
# by a Friday (the eastward IDL step repeated the weekday) while the calendar
# jumped Julian->Gregorian (Wikipedia, "Alaska Purchase": "the Julian calendar
# in the 19th century was 12 days behind the Gregorian").
#
# Modelled faithfully, per those sources, as BOTH kinds at the single seam:
#   * a **calendar-switch segment boundary** at the first post-seam Gregorian
#     day (Julian before it, Gregorian after) with **no** ``jdn_shift`` — the
#     eastward IDL step and the Julian->Gregorian catch-up cancel, so Alaska
#     leaves the seam aligned with the rest of the US Gregorian calendar and
#     carries NO permanent day offset (a modern Alaskan date is exactly its
#     proleptic-Gregorian label); the 11 intervening Gregorian dates (7–17
#     October 1867) that no Alaskan civil day bore therefore read as a SKIP;
#   * the **REPEAT** records the doubled Friday: because the Julian->Gregorian
#     gap (+12) and the eastward dateline step (-1) net to +11, the last Julian
#     day and the first Gregorian day share one solar JDN — 6-Oct-Julian and
#     18-Oct-Gregorian resolve, *each through its own calendar*, to the SAME JDN
#     (``julian_to_jdn(1867,10,6) == gregorian_to_jdn(1867,10,18)``), hence the
#     same weekday: one Friday wearing two civil labels.
# Unlike an ordinary fall-back REPEAT (one label, two JDNs, returned by to_jdn
# as a two-candidate tuple), Alaska's is a *weekday* repeat — two labels, one
# JDN.  ``from_jdn`` surfaces the outgoing Julian label ("6 October") on that
# shared day; ``to_jdn`` maps BOTH labels to it (the incoming "18 October",
# homeless in its own post-seam segment, is routed to the shared JDN via the
# REPEAT discontinuity), so ``to_jdn((1867,10,6)) == to_jdn((1867,10,18))``.
