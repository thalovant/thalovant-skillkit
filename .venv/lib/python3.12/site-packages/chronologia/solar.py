"""Arithmetic solar events: sunrise, sunset, solar noon, and twilights.

Transcribes the NOAA *General Solar Position Calculations* / *Sunrise/Sunset
Calculations* (NOAA Global Monitoring Division) closed-form algorithm,
per the NOAA Global Monitoring solar calculator.
Given a calendar date, latitude, and longitude the algorithm yields the day's
sunrise, sunset, solar noon, and the three standard twilight boundaries
(civil / nautical / astronomical, at solar depression -6 / -12 / -18 degrees).

Accuracy (class B -- convention-bearing, not an ephemeris): the NOAA method is
a low-order truncated series stated by NOAA to be accurate to within about a
minute for the years 1901..2099, degrading outside that range and toward the
poles; :data:`SOLAR_ACCURACY` exposes the +/- one minute bound.  Standard
atmospheric refraction and solar-disk size are folded into the fixed
rise/set zenith of 90.833 degrees (NOAA's stated convention); no altitude,
temperature, or pressure correction beyond that is applied.

**Equation of time.**  The algorithm needs the equation of time *and* the solar
declination from the *same* fractional-year angle ``gamma``, so this module
implements NOAA's own ``eqtime``/``decl`` series internally rather than reusing
:func:`chronologia.localtime.equation_of_time` (a different -- Woolf / PVCDROM --
approximation).  Sharing one ``gamma`` keeps declination and equation of time
mutually consistent, which the sunrise formula requires; the two EoT series
agree within their combined stated accuracy (a consistency check lives in the
test suite).  ``gamma`` is evaluated at local noon (the ``(hour-12)/24`` term
is zero), giving one declination/EoT pair per day as the NOAA daily calculator
does.

**Reference frame.**  All returned instants are **UTC** (:class:`AstroDate`),
matching NOAA's ``sunrise = 720 - 4*(longitude + ha) - eqtime`` which yields
minutes past UTC midnight.  Longitude is **east-positive** (ISO 6709, the
convention shared with :mod:`chronologia.localtime`); NOAA's own text states
"longitude ... positive to the east of the Prime Meridian".

**Polar honesty.**  When the sun never rises or never sets for a given field at
a given date and latitude, that field is a typed :class:`NoSunEvent` (the
``NeverExisted`` pattern) carrying the ``kind`` (``polar_day``/``polar_night``),
never a fabricated time and never an exception.  Each boundary is evaluated
independently, so a polar day where the sun clears the horizon but never the
civil-twilight line reports a real ``sunset`` alongside a ``NoSunEvent`` civil
dusk.

    that zone on that date.  The UTC solar day and the zone's civil day need
    not coincide (a zone west of Greenwich starts its civil day before the UTC
    day that shares its date; a zone far east, after), so this method computes
    the ordinary solar-day events for ``date - 1``, ``date``, and ``date + 1``
    (covering any zone offset up to the day boundaries) and, for each field
    independently, keeps whichever of those crossings converts (via
    :meth:`AstroDate.astimezone`) into the requested civil window.

    Because a day can be dropped or repeated at the International Date Line,
    the civil day *can* contain two occurrences of one kind of event (or,
    symmetrically, zero) -- the classic case being a zone many hours ahead of
    UTC (e.g. ``Pacific/Kiritimati``, UTC+14) paired with a longitude that
    still sits west of the date line, so its solar sunrise/sunset instants and
    its civil day disagree about which calendar date they fall on.  When two
    occurrences land in the civil window, **the first (earlier) instant is
    returned** -- the same "first crossing wins" convention as the plain
    solar-day method already uses for a single day; when none does (a
    persistent high-latitude polar day/night), the :class:`NoSunEvent` for the
    solar day sharing ``date``'s own calendar date is returned, since a
    :class:`NoSunEvent` names no instant to reinterpret in ``zone``.

    Every returned :class:`AstroDate` (``solar_noon`` and any real
    rise/set/twilight field) is **aware**, converted into ``zone`` via
    :meth:`~chronologia.astrodate.AstroDate.astimezone`; ``NoSunEvent`` fields
