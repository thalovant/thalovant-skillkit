"""Historical local time: local mean time and apparent solar time.

Before the railways forced standard time zones (Britain 1847, the
international zone system from 1884), every town kept its own clock set
by the sun.  This module reconstructs the two civil time reckonings that
predate the zones, both expressed against a single UTC/GMT reference so
they compose with the rest of :mod:`chronologia`:

* **Local mean time (LMT)** -- mean solar time at a meridian.  The clock
  runs on the *mean* (fictitious, uniform-rate) sun, so it advances at a
  constant rate; it differs from UTC purely by the observer's longitude,
  at the Earth's rotation rate of 4 minutes of time per degree
  (360 degrees / 24 h).  East of Greenwich is *ahead* of UTC (positive
  offset), west is *behind*.  :func:`local_mean_time` builds the
  :class:`LMTZone` fixed-offset zone for a longitude.

* **Apparent solar time** -- what a sundial reads: mean solar time
  corrected by the *equation of time*, the accumulated effect of the
  Earth's orbital eccentricity and axial tilt that makes the true sun run
  ahead of or behind the mean sun over the year (:func:`equation_of_time`,
  :func:`apparent_solar_time`).

Convention (class B -- convention-bearing, not a physical measurement):
LMT is *mean* solar time at the meridian, so it carries no equation-of-time
correction; apparent solar time adds that correction.  Longitude sign is
**east positive** (ISO 6709 / the geographic convention), so Lisbon at
about 9.14 degrees W has a *negative* longitude and a *negative* (behind
UTC) offset.

Source for the equation of time: Honsberg & Bowden, "Solar Time"
(PVCDROM / PVEducation), transcribing the NOAA/Woolf closed-form
approximation. It states the formula is accurate to within half a minute;
that bound is exposed as :data:`EOT_ACCURACY`.
