"""One utterance -> one :class:`Event`: the capstone composition.

An :class:`Event` is what a human means by "an appointment": a *summary* (what
it is), a *span* (when its first occurrence starts and ends), an optional
*duration*, and an optional *recurrence*.  :func:`extract_event` builds one from
a single natural-language utterance by **composing the extraction edges already
in the library** -- it writes no new grammar:

    "my weekly meeting every wednesday at 9 for 30 minutes"
        summary    = "my weekly meeting"
        recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=WE;BYHOUR=9
        duration   = 30 minutes
        span       = the next Wednesday 09:00 .. 09:30

Mechanism -- the remainders chain
---------------------------------
The three edges run in a fixed order, each consuming its own phrase and handing
the *leftover text* to the next:

1. :func:`~chronologia.extract.extract_recurrence` reads the recurring phrase
   ("every wednesday at 9"); its remainder feeds
2. :func:`~chronologia.extract.extract_duration`, which reads the length ("for
   30 minutes"); its remainder feeds
3. :func:`~chronologia.extract.extract_timespan` (only when there is *no*
   recurrence -- a recurring event takes its span from the rule's first
   occurrence, not from a bare date in the text).

Whatever text survives all three, stripped of the stranded connector words the
edges leave behind ("for", "at", "on", a trailing article), is the **summary**.

The **span** is the event's first concrete occurrence: for a recurring event it
is the recurrence expanded once from the anchor; for a one-off it is the parsed
span.  When a duration is present the span's end is pinned to
``start + duration`` so the span always carries the real width (and the iCal
writer's ``DTEND`` is correct).
