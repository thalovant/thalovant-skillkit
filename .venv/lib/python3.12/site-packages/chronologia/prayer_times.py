"""Islamic prayer times as cited angle-set variants over the solar machinery.

The five daily prayers plus sunrise are computed from the same NOAA solar
hour-angle engine that :mod:`chronologia.solar` uses; this module adds only the
*jurisprudential* parameters that distinguish the published calculation
conventions -- the twilight depression angles for Fajr and Isha and the shadow
factor for Asr.  Nothing here rules on which convention is correct: each is a
named school with different published angles, and the library computes what the
angles imply and no more.

**Source.**  Definitions, per-convention angles, and the hour-angle / shadow
formulas transcribe the PrayTimes reference documentation --
https://praytimes.org/calculation.  The Fajr/Isha depression-angle table and
the Asr shadow factors (1 = majority/Shafi'i, 2 = Hanafi) are quoted verbatim
in :data:`CONVENTIONS` and :data:`ASR_METHODS` citations.

**The formulas.**  With ``Dhuhr`` the solar noon (PrayTimes:
``Dhuhr = 12 + TimeZone - Lng/15 - EqT``, here evaluated directly in UTC by
:func:`chronologia.solar.sun_events`):

- ``Fajr  = Dhuhr - T(alpha_fajr)`` and ``Isha = Dhuhr + T(alpha_isha)`` where
  ``T(alpha)`` is the depression-angle hour angle -- exactly the crossing the
  solar engine computes at zenith ``90 + alpha`` (the same form the civil /
  nautical / astronomical twilights use, with the convention's angle in place
  of 6 / 12 / 18 degrees).
- ``Asr = Dhuhr + A(t)`` where ``A(t)`` is the hour angle at which an upright
  object's shadow reaches ``t`` times its height *plus its noon shadow*:
  the sun altitude ``h`` satisfies ``cot(h) = t + tan(|L - D|)`` (``L``
  latitude, ``D`` declination), and the crossing is computed at zenith
  ``90 - h``.
- ``Sunrise`` is the 90.833-degree rise crossing and ``Maghrib`` is sunset --
  both taken straight from :func:`~chronologia.solar.sun_events`.

**Dhuhr margin.**  PrayTimes notes that "a slight margin is usually considered
for Dhuhr"; it is a precautionary custom, not prescribed in the base formula
(``Dhuhr`` = solar noon).  This module reports solar noon unmodified and adds no
margin -- the golden rule again: compute, do not rule.

**Maghrib delay.**  Likewise the 1-3 minute precautionary delay after sunset is
optional custom; ``maghrib`` is the computed sunset exactly.

**High-latitude honesty.**  When the sun never reaches the depression angle
(the short summer nights of high latitudes -- "white nights"), Fajr and/or Isha
are *undefined*: the field is a typed :class:`~chronologia.solar.NoSunEvent`,
never a fabricated time.  The various higher-latitude estimation rules
(middle-of-the-night, one-seventh, angle-based) are **out of scope**: they are
jurisprudential choices about what to substitute when the arithmetic yields
nothing, not arithmetic themselves, and different authorities pick differently.
The variant mechanism here (a frozen convention record) is exactly where such a
rule would later attach as another named school -- but this library will not
invent one.
